Question: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
====================================
Generated Answer: **
A) $16
B) $24
C) $32
D) $48
E) $64
Answer:
To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to break down her daily earnings into the components she gets from the eggs and the earnings from selling the remaining ducks.

1. **Earnings from eggs:**
   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends.
   - **Eggs used for breakfast:** 3 eggs
   - **Eggs used for baking:** 4 eggs
   - **Eggs remaining at market:** 16 - 3 - 4 = **9 eggs**

2. **Earnings from eggs at market:**
   - **9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18**

3. **Earnings from ducks:**
   - **16 eggs * $2 per egg = $32**

4. **Total earnings:**
   - **$18 (from eggs) + $32 (from ducks) = $50**

However, the question asks for the amount she makes **at the farmers' market**, which includes the earnings from the eggs. So, the correct answer is **$32**.

Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
====================================
Generated Answer:   A. 2  B. 4  C. 6  D. 8  E. 10
Answer:
We are given that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.

To find the total number of bolts, we need to add the blue and white fibers together.

The blue fiber takes 2 bolts, and half of that is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3.

However, looking at the answer choices, the correct answer is not 3. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's re-examine the problem.

The problem states: "a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber."

This could mean that the white fiber is half the number of blue fibers. If the blue fiber is 2, then the white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1.

So, the total number of bolts is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3.

But since the answer choices do not include 3, this suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices. However, based on the given information, the correct answer should be 3.

But since the answer choices are A. 2, B. 4, C. 6, D. 8, E. 10, and 3 is not among them, there might be a mistake in the problem statement. However, based on the information provided, the correct answer is 3.

Question: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
====================================
Generated Answer:   A) $10,000 B) $15,000 C) $20,000 D) $25,000
Answer:
To find the profit Josh made, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and then subtract the value of the house he bought.

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs. The value of the house increased by 150%, which means the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + 150% of $80,000.

Calculating the increase in value:
$$
150\% \times 80,000 = 0.15 \times 80,000 = 12,000
$$

Total value after repairs:
$$
80,000 + 12,000 = 92,000
$$

Profit is the difference between the total value and the cost:
$$
92,000 - 80,000 = 12,000
$$

However, the question states that the value increased by 150%, which might mean that the profit is the increase in value. But the options don't include $12,000. Let's check the options again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recalculate the profit correctly. The profit is the amount he made from the house's value increase. If the value increased by 150%, then the profit is 150% of the original value.

Original value: $80,000
Profit: 150% of 80,000 = 0.15 * 80,000 = 12,000

But the options don't have $12,000. Let's check the options again:

A) $10,000
B) $15,000
C) $20,000
D) $25,000

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the profit after repairs, which would be the increase in value. But the options don't have $12,000. Let's check again.

Wait, maybe the value increased by 150%, so the profit is 150% of the cost. The cost is $80,000, so profit is 150% of 80
