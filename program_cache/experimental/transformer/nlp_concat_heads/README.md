NLP Concat Heads â€” Program Cache Review

Summary

- Reviewed `ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/experimental/transformer/nlp_concat_heads/device/nlp_concat_heads_program_factory.cpp` and `.../nlp_concat_heads_device_operation.cpp` (old/type-erased infra via ProgramWithCallbacks).
- Cache-hit override correctly updates all runtime-only values (input/output buffer base addresses) for both interleaved and sharded variants. No issues found.

Key observations

- Program creation sets per-core runtime args:
  - Interleaved reader args: `[in0_buffer_addr, num_blocks_per_core, in0_h_dim, in0_tensor_tile_id]`.
  - Interleaved writer args: `[out_buffer_addr, tiles_to_write, start_tile_id]` using `writer_unary_interleaved_start_id.cpp`.
  - Sharded: CBs for input/output are created with globally allocated addresses; runtime args hold counts/offsets only.
- On cache hit, override callback updates:
  - Interleaved: reader arg 0 = input buffer address, writer arg 0 = output buffer address.
  - Sharded: updates dynamic CB base addresses for input and output to the new buffers.
- Count/offset runtime args derive from hashed properties (shape, layout, sharding split) and remain constant for a given cache key; not updated on cache hit, which is correct.

Files reviewed

- `ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/experimental/transformer/nlp_concat_heads/device/nlp_concat_heads_device_operation.cpp`

Conclusion

- Override path mirrors creation-time runtime-arg ordering and updates all buffer addresses appropriately. No cache correctness issues identified.

Suggested tests (optional)

- Two-run cache test varying only tensor buffers (same shapes/dtypes/mem-config) to validate cache-hit path updates addresses correctly for both interleaved and sharded tensors.
