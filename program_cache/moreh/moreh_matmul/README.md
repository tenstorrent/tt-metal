# moreh/moreh_matmul program cache review

Findings:
- Override updates reader args[0]=input, args[1]=other, and last bias address only if bias present; writer args[0]=output. Indices align with create-time ordering even with variable-length rt args due to appended strides.
- No cache-hit issues identified.

No failure tests added. Reviewed and marked as reviewed.
