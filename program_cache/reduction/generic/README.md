Findings:
- Uses the old type-erased infra with override callbacks in at least the H-dimension multi-core path; width-sharded path updates dynamic CB addresses for source/output; interleaved path updates reader/writer kernel runtime args per-core.
- Hashing relies on default op hashing with attributes covering reduce op type, dimension, compute kernel config, memory configs, and sub-core grids; tensor args include shapes/dtypes/layouts.

No program-cache issues identified.

Suggested optional tests:
- Two-run cache tests for both interleaved and width-sharded cases that reallocate input/output while keeping attributes constant; assert single cache entry and correctness on cache hit.
