Hey!

I want to support tiled output in a pool op.
As you can see in a few previous commits, i changed compute kernel to do tilize after every 32 sticks are filled.
Also I hardcoded tile layout in code. I added one more cb to buffer output sticks.
What I want now, is to make this optional. I want to have 2 optional args in maxpool - out data format (default to BF16), and out layout (default is ROW MAJOR).
Reason for this is to not break anything - currently we support just BF16 RM output. That means that you need to change output dims, cb allocation, etc.
Can you make .md file where you will put initial plan? I want small steps, and for each step I want what needs to be changed, why, and how it would be tested. I want to do this step by step, and after each step I want to be sure that this is correct.

Hang recover mechanism
----------------------
 nice! now before going to step 2, i want you to create hang recover mechanism. also, add this mechanism to reminder in plan (maybe some subsection). i want you do this    │
│   mechanism every time we continue to develop, so you can have reminder for that.
When hang is happened, I want you to trigger this mechanism.
So you need to: do these steps first time:
- create new instance of terminal
- cd ~/tt-smi
- pip install .
- tt-smi -r 1
Every other time, do this in same instance of termina:
- tt-smi -r 1
Don't close this terminal while working
Also set timeout for hang detection to 30s.
So this terminal is always opened (you do first set of it just once)
For this first time implementing this mechanism, please remove some push_back from maxpool reader to make hang happen, to test this functionality.
