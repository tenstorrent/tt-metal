I want to make MaxPool3d op. These are steps:
- I want basic solution, so simpliest one.
- Input and output is DRAM Interleaved
- Both input and output is in Row major layout
- You can look at conv3d implementation for the reference
- Register operation
- Make some simple test in appropriate file (it would compare result to torch reference)
- Make whole op infrastructure
- Make pool3d factory
- Make reader, compute, and writer kernel
- Reader kernel should get Tin,Tout,Hin,Hout,Win,Wout (lets say N=1 for the beginning), and it would fetch approriate sticks from DRAM (so for 2x2x2 filter, 8 sticks for one output sticks)
- Compute would find max for every channel, and output out stick
- Writer kernel would send it back to DRAM output

Do you need more info?


PASS 2
- In this version, let's have compute kernel that will compute result on RISC, don't use SFPU/FPU.
- Reader kernel should send window_size_hwt sticks, and compute kernel should just find max for each channel

PASS 3
- I want to have maxpool3d - you almost did everything
- Now let's change compute kernel to just handle synchronization with reader and writer kernel
- So only task is not to hang, we can have PCC issues
- Reader kernel should get Tin,Tout,Hin,Hout,Win,Wout (lets say N=1 for the beginning), and it would fetch approriate sticks from DRAM (so for 2x2x2 filter, 8 sticks for one output sticks) (YOU DID THIS)
- Compute would find max for every channel, and output out stick (for now just return first stick)
- Writer kernel would send it back to DRAM output (YOU DID THIS)

PASS 4
- I want to have functional compute for maxpool3d
- Can you give me some plan for it, and put it in some textual file?
