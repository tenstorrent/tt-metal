- branch: ssinghal/mimo
- host: DC16-2-BG-0204-u20-44
- track: decision
- status: inferred
- claim: Coordinator start: read onboarding/skills/guide/study. Spot-checked against modeling_mimo_v2.py: router (sigmoid, bias for selection only, weights from unbiased score, norm_topk_prob, scale 1.0) matches study; SWA sinks, rope_dim=int(192*0.334)=64, v_scale present. NOT verified: qkv row layout, SWA mask off-by-one, sink convention on device, op limits. Hosts OK at 2026-10-07: 30 33 34 40 41 44; busy with DSV4: 32 43 45 47. Scorecard adds 64k gates; gsm8k threshold n=64/min 55 is a template default, provisional.
