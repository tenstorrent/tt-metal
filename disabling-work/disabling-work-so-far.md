# CI Disable Work — Status Log

> **Source of truth.** This file is the canonical record of automation-tracked PRs. Wiping it resets the automation to fresh-state view; stale GitHub PRs not listed here are intentionally invisible.

Last updated: **2026-05-29T04:00 UTC** — Session: Examining lane (2 PRs classified as verified-pass): PR #45498 (run 26614829843 failure → verified-pass; disabled tests skipped, 30 passed, 1 pre-existing error [8-8-8-8] also on main), PR #45500 (run 26614947278 failure → verified-pass; target [WH-T3K] sampling-tests PASSED; BH-QB-GE infra fault, WH-GLX Galaxy out-of-scope). Focus lane: 0 new PRs — all checked uncovered workflows (single-card model perf, T3K perf tests) have timeout/hang failures only, not deterministic test failures eligible for disable. PR #45507 run 26615944303 still in progress.

## How to read/update this file

- Read this file at the start of every automation session and treat it as the authoritative current state for CI disable work.
- Scan the `## Quick Index` table first; it gives the lifecycle stage per PR before drilling into details.
- Per-PR sections use uniform field tables (`PR | Disable issue | Timeout issue | Branch | Workflow file | Lifecycle stage | Last rebase | Last revalidation | Verification run | Last touched by automation | Readiness`); update fields in place rather than rewriting the section. `Last touched by automation: <UTC ISO>` is required on every PR row and drives the 4-hour throttle — update it every time the automation does any work on the PR (rebase, dispatch, log analysis, comment, removal).
- Each PR section also carries a `Disables (with main evidence)` table listing every currently-disabled test ID together with the most recent failing main-run job-link (`/runs/<id>/job/<jid>`) and the run completion timestamp. This mirrors the PR description's evidence table (see `disabling-work/ci-disable-targeted-verification.md` → `Main-run evidence model`) and is the starting point the next session re-checks before doing any work on the PR. If keeping the state log compact is preferred, the per-PR section MAY instead include the one-line pointer `Main-run evidence: see PR description.` — the PR description's evidence table is authoritative either way. Preserve any existing PR entries unchanged when extending the schema.
- Append new entries to the top of `## Recent Activity` (most recent first); keep at most 30 entries — trim older entries to a single `- Older history truncated — see git history of this file.` line if needed.
- Commit and push any change to this file before ending the session.
- Lifecycle stages: `new`, `batch-committed`, `verifying`, `verification-inconclusive`, `verified-pass`, `verified-fail`, `merged`, `out-of-scope`. (`verification-inconclusive` = a verification was dispatched but failed to actually exercise the previously-passing jobs; eligible for re-dispatch and does NOT consume the one-run-per-PR budget.)

PR #45500 (run [26614947278](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/actions/runs/26614947278) completed `failure` → **verified-pass**; target `[WH-T3K] Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with sampling-tests` **PASSED**; BH-QB-GE failure = infra fault, EngineCore failed to start — not a code regression; WH-GLX failure = Galaxy, out of scope; revalidation: sampling tests still failing in main run 26611126930 job 78418064065). PR #45494 per-PR section fixed (lifecycle was incorrectly `verifying` in per-PR section; Quick Index was already correct at `verified-pass` from previous session). PR #45507 run 26615944303 still in progress — left as `verifying`, will classify next session. Focus lane: 0 new PRs — checked uncovered workflows: `(Single-card) Model perf tests` failure = timeout/hang (`Setting cpu` loop then `Cleaning up orphan processes` with no test output) — out of scope; `(T3K) T3000 perf tests` failure = same timeout/hang pattern in all 3 failing jobs — out of scope. No other eligible uncovered non-Galaxy workflows found with ≥3 consecutive deterministic test failures. Focus slots filled: 0/3 (no eligible uncovered workflows). State log corrected and pushed.

The session created the PR + dispatched the run but did NOT push the state log update at session-end; this entry is the human/manual backfill that closes that gap.
