# CI Disable — Galaxy Pipelines: Work So Far

> **Source of truth.** This file is the canonical record of automation-tracked PRs. Wiping it resets the automation to fresh-state view; stale GitHub PRs not listed here are intentionally invisible.

Last updated: _(none yet — initial skeleton)_

> **Scope: GALAXY PIPELINES ONLY.** Companion file to `disabling-work/ci-disable-targeted-verification-galaxy.md`. The non-Galaxy state log is `disabling-work/disabling-work-so-far.md`; do not confuse the two.

## How to read/update this file

- Read this file at the start of every automation session and treat it as the authoritative current state for CI disable work.
- Scan the `## Quick Index` table first; it gives the lifecycle stage per PR before drilling into details.
- Per-PR sections use uniform field tables (`PR | Disable issue | Timeout issue | Branch | Workflow file | Lifecycle stage | Last rebase | Last revalidation | Verification run | Last touched by automation | Readiness`); update fields in place rather than rewriting the section. `Last touched by automation: <UTC ISO>` is required on every PR row and drives the 4-hour throttle — update it every time the automation does any work on the PR (rebase, dispatch, log analysis, comment, removal).
- Each PR section also carries a `Disables (with main evidence)` table listing every currently-disabled test ID together with the most recent failing main-run job-link (`/runs/<id>/job/<jid>`) and the run completion timestamp. This mirrors the PR description's evidence table (see `disabling-work/ci-disable-targeted-verification-galaxy.md` → `Main-run evidence model`) and is the starting point the next session re-checks before doing any work on the PR. If keeping the state log compact is preferred, the per-PR section MAY instead include the one-line pointer `Main-run evidence: see PR description.` — the PR description's evidence table is authoritative either way. Preserve any existing PR entries unchanged when extending the schema.
- Append new entries to the top of `## Recent Activity` (most recent first); keep at most 30 entries — trim older entries to a single `- Older history truncated — see git history of this file.` line if needed.
- Commit and push any change to this file before ending the session.
- Lifecycle stages: `new`, `batch-committed`, `verifying`, `verification-inconclusive`, `verified-pass`, `verified-fail`, `merged`, `out-of-scope`. (`verification-inconclusive` = a verification was dispatched but failed to actually exercise the previously-passing jobs; eligible for re-dispatch and does NOT consume the one-run-per-PR budget.)
