# Yolo12X

## Platforms:
Wormhole (n150, n300), Blackhole (p150)

## Prerequisites
- Cloned [tt-metal repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) for source code
- Installed: [TT-Metalium™ / TT-NN™](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)

## Introduction:

Yolov12 has an attention-centric architecture that moves away from the traditional CNN-based approaches of previous YOLO models while preserving the real-time inference speed crucial for many applications. This model leverages innovative attention mechanisms and a redesigned network architecture to achieve state-of-the-art object detection accuracy without compromising real-time performance.
