# ViT

## Platforms:
    Grayskull

## Introduction
The Vision Transformer (ViT) model was proposed in "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words, Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale".
It’s the first paper that successfully trains a Transformer encoder on ImageNet, attaining very good results compared to familiar convolutional architectures.

## Prerequisites
- Cloned [tt-metal repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) for source code
- Installed: [TT-Metalium™ / TT-NN™](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)
  - To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with: `./build_metal.sh -p`

## How to Run
To run the demo for question answering using the Bloom model, follow these instructions:
-  For Imagenet-21K to test inference accuracy, use the following command to run the demo:
  ```sh
  pytest --disable-warnings  models/demos/grayskull/vit/demo/demo_vit_ttnn_imagenet_inference.py
  ```

-  For the inference overall runtime (end-2-end), use the following command to run the demo:
  ```sh
  pytest --disable-warnings  models/demos/grayskull/vit/demo/demo_vit_ttnn_inference_perf_e2e_2cq_trace.py
  ```

-  For running the inference device OPs analysis, use the following command to run the demo:
  ```sh
  # Need to enable the profiler by building with ./build_metal.sh -p
  ./tt_metal/tools/profiler/profile_this.py -n vit -c "pytest --disable-warnings  models/demos/grayskull/vit/demo/demo_vit_ttnn_inference_device_OPs.py"
  ```

## Details
- The Imagenet-21K inference accuracy is 79%
- Model runtime (host end-2-end) with batch_size=9 is 1360 FPS
- Device OPs runtime summation will is 1750 FPS (batch_size=9)
