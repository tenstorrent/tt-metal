# Yolov7

## Platforms:
    Wormhole (n150, n300), Blackhole (p150)

## Introduction
YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detector that surpasses all known object detectors in both speed and accuracy. It builds on the YOLO family of detectors and introduces significant architectural improvements for enhanced speed and accuracy. YOLOv7 supports advanced features such as model reparameterization, extended model scaling, and multi-task capabilities including object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation.
