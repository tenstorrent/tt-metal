# Yolov11n - Model

### Platforms:

Wormhole N150, N300

### Note:

- On N300, Make sure to use `WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml` with the pytest.

- Or, make sure to set the following environment variable in the terminal:
  ```
  export WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml
  ```
- To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with following command:
  ```
  ./build_metal.sh -p
  ```

## Introduction

**YOLOv11n** is the smallest variant in the YOLOV11 series, it offers improvements in accuracy, speed, and efficiency for real-time object detection. It features enhanced architecture and optimized training methods, suitable for various computer vision tasks.


### Details

- The entry point to the `yolov11` is located at : `models/demos/yolov11/tt/ttnn_yolov11.py`
- Batch Size : `1` (Single Device), `2` (Multi Device).
- Supported Input Resolution : `(640, 640)` - (Height, Width).
- Dataset used for evaluation : **COCO-2017**

## How to Run:

Use the following command to run the model :

```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/tests/pcc/test_ttnn_yolov11.py::test_yolov11
```

#
## Model performant running with Trace+2CQ

### Single Device (BS=1):
- For `640x640`, end-2-end perf is `145` FPS :

```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/tests/perf/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant
```
### Performant Demo with Trace+2CQ

### Multi Device (DP=2, N300):

- For `640x640`, end-2-end perf is `275` FPS :

  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/tests/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant_dp
  ```

### Demo with Trace+2CQ

#### Note: Output images will be saved in the `models/demos/yolov11/demo/runs` folder.

### Single Device (BS=1):

#### Custom Images:

- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :

    ```bash
    pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo
    ```

- To use a different image(s) for demo, replace your image(s) in the image path `models/demos/yolov11/demo/images` and run :

    ```bash
    pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo
    ```

#### COCO-2017 dataset:

- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :

  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dataset
  ```

### Multi Device (DP=2, N300):

#### Custom Images:

- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :

  ```bash
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dp
  ```

- To use a different image(s) for demo, replace your image(s) in the image path `models/demos/yolov8x/demo/images` and run :

  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dp
  ```

#### Coco-2017 dataset:

- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :

  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dataset_dp
  ```


### Performant evaluation with Trace+2CQ
Use the following command to run the performant evaluation with Trace+2CQs:

```
pytest models/experimental/yolo_eval/evaluate.py::test_yolov11n[res0-device_params0-tt_model]
```
Note: The model is evaluated with 500 samples.
