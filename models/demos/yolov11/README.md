# Yolov11n

## Platforms:
    Wormhole (n150, n300)

## Introduction
**YOLOv11n** is the smallest variant in the YOLOV11 series, it offers improvements in accuracy, speed, and efficiency for real-time object detection. It features enhanced architecture and optimized training methods, suitable for various computer vision tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Cloned [tt-metal repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) for source code
- Installed: [TT-Metalium™ / TT-NN™](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)
  - To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with: `./build_metal.sh -p`

## How to Run
Use the following command to run the model:
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/tests/pcc/test_ttnn_yolov11.py::test_yolov11
```

### Model performant running with Trace+2CQ
#### Single Device (BS=1):
- For `640x640`, end-2-end perf is `145` FPS :
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/tests/perf/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant
```

### Performant Demo with Trace+2CQ
#### Multi Device (DP=2, N300):
- For `640x640`, end-2-end perf is `275` FPS :
  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/tests/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant_dp
  ```

### Demo with Trace+2CQ
Note: Output images will be saved in the `models/demos/yolov11/demo/runs` folder.

#### Single Device (BS=1)
##### Custom Images:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :
  ```bash
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo
  ```
  - To use a different image(s) for demo, replace your image(s) in the image path `models/demos/yolov11/demo/images` and run the same command.

#### COCO-2017 dataset:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :
  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dataset
  ```

### Multi Device (DP=2, n300)
#### Custom Images:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution:
  ```bash
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dp
  ```
  - To use a different image(s) for demo, replace your image(s) in the image path `models/demos/yolov8x/demo/images` and run the same command.

#### Coco-2017 dataset:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :
  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov11/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dataset_dp
  ```

## Testing
### Performant evaluation with Trace+2CQ
Use the following command to run the performant evaluation with Trace+2CQs:
```
pytest models/experimental/yolo_eval/evaluate.py::test_yolov11n[res0-device_params0-tt_model]
```
Note: The model is evaluated with 500 samples.
