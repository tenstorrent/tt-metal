# YOLOV10x

## Platforms:
    Wormhole (n150, n300)

## Introduction:
Demo showcasing Yolov10x running on Wormhole - n150, n300 using ttnn.

YOLOv10x introduces a new approach to real-time object detection, addressing both the post-processing and model architecture deficiencies found in previous YOLO versions. By eliminating non-maximum suppression (NMS) and optimizing various model components, YOLOv10x achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior accuracy-latency trade-offs across multiple model scales. We've used weights available [here](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10x/#performance) under YOLOV10x.

## Prerequisites
- Cloned [tt-metal repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) for source code
- Installed: [TT-Metalium™ / TT-NN™](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)
  - To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with: `./build_metal.sh -p`

## How to Run
Use the following command to run the Yolov10x model:
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/tests/pcc/test_ttnn_yolov10x.py::test_yolov10x
```

### Model Performant with Trace+2CQ
#### Single Device (BS=1):
- For `640x640`, end-2-end perf is `42` FPS.

  ```bash
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/tests/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant
  ```

#### Multi Device (DP=2, n300):
- For `640x640`, end-2-end perf is `83` FPS.

  ```bash
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/tests/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant_dp
  ```

### Demo
Note: Output images will be saved in the `models/demos/yolov10x/demo/runs` folder.

#### Single Device (BS=1)
##### Custom Images:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution:

    ```bash
    pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/demo/demo.py::test_demo
    ```
  - To use a different image(s) for demo, replace your image(s) in the image path `models/demos/yolov10x/demo/images`

##### Coco-2017 dataset:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution:
  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dataset
  ```

#### Multi Device (DP=2, n300)
##### Custom Images:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution:
  ```bash
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dp
  ```

##### Coco-2017 dataset:
- Use the following command to run demo for `640x640` resolution :

  ```
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov10x/demo/demo.py::test_demo_dataset_dp
  ```

### Web Demo:
Try the interactive web demo at [yolov10x/web_demo](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/models/demos/yolov10x/web_demo/README.md)

## Details
- The entry point to yolov10x model is YoloV10x in `models/demos/yolov10x/tt/ttnn_yolov10x.py`.
- Batch Size : `1` (Single Device), `2` (Multi Device).
- Supported Input Resolution : `(640, 640)` - (Height, Width).
- Dataset used for evaluation : **COCO-2017**
- Note: The post-processing is performed using PyTorch.

### Inputs
The demo receives inputs from `models/demos/yolov10x/demo/images` dir by default. To test the model on different input data, it is recommended to add a new image file to this directory.

### Outputs
A runs folder will be created inside the `models/demos/yolov10x/demo/` directory. For reference, the model output will be stored in the torch_model directory, while the TTNN model output will be stored in the tt_model directory.

### Additional Information:
The tests can be run with  randomly initialized weights and pre-trained real weights.  To run only for the pre-trained weights, specify pretrained_weight_true when running the tests.
