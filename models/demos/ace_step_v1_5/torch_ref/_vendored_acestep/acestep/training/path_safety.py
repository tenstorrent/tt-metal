"""Path sanitisation helpers for training modules.

Provides a single ``safe_path`` function that validates user-provided
filesystem paths against a known safe root directory.  The validation
uses ``os.path.realpath`` followed by a ``.startswith`` check — the
exact pattern that CodeQL recognises as a sanitiser for the
``py/path-injection`` query.

Symlinks are resolved on both the root and user paths so that paths
through symlinks (e.g. ``/root/data`` → ``/vepfs/.../data``) are
compared consistently.

All training modules that accept user-supplied paths should call
``safe_path`` (or ``safe_open``) before performing any filesystem I/O.
