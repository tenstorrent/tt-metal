"""Always-on trace+2CQ performant runner for ACE-Step v1.5.

Mirrors ``models/experimental/swin_v2/runner/performant_runner.py``:

- Construction takes a device handle + model config, builds the TTNN model, and
  immediately runs a warmup ``generate`` so the DiT body trace is captured before
  the first user-visible ``run(prompt)`` call.
- ``run(prompt)`` replays the captured trace via 2 command queues (host->device
  copies on CQ 1, ``execute_trace`` on CQ 0). Steady-state cost is text encoder +
  condition encoder + SDPA mask build + N traced DiT replays + VAE decode.
- ``release()`` releases the captured trace id + persistent DiT buffers.

Unlike :mod:`models.demos.ace_step_v1_5.ttnn_impl.e2e_model_tt`, this runner does
not require ``ACE_STEP_USE_TRACE=1`` on the command line — tracing is force-enabled
at construction time. The env var is only set within the runner's own process so
external scripts (e.g. ``run_prompt_to_wav.py``) that bypass the runner keep the
opt-in semantics they already document.

Device requirements (same as the SwinV2 runner):

- 2 command queues (``ttnn.open_device(num_command_queues=2, ...)``)
- ``trace_region_size`` large enough for the DiT body capture
  (the demo conftest under ``perf/`` defaults to 128 MB which is sufficient)

The ``perf/conftest.py`` ``device`` fixture already satisfies both.

class AceStepPerformantRunner:
    """SwinV2-style perf runner wrapping :class:`AceStepE2EModel`.

    Construction:
        1. Sets ``ACE_STEP_USE_TRACE=1`` in the current process so the e2e model
           opts into the DiT body trace path during ``__init__`` (the model reads
           the env var via :func:`_e2e_trace_enabled`).
        2. Builds :class:`AceStepE2EModel` — uploads weights, prepares convs,
           precomputes per-step time embeddings, caches the silence-context.
        3. Runs one warmup ``generate(warmup_prompt)`` to:
              - drive the first two eager Euler steps (program-cache fill)
              - capture the DiT body trace (``begin_trace_capture`` /
                ``end_trace_capture``)
              - leave the trace id released at end-of-loop so the next
                ``run(prompt)`` re-arms it via :meth:`_E2EDenoiseTrace.recapture`
                against the same persistent buffers.

    Steady-state ``run(prompt)``:
        - text encoder (skipped on cache hit for the same prompt + duration)
        - condition encoder (same caching)
        - SDPA mask build (cached per-prompt inside the pipeline)
        - prime persistent trace buffers with this prompt's enc/ctx/mask
        - recapture trace id, run N traced DiT replays
        - VAE decode (tiled)

    Cleanup via :meth:`release` frees the captured trace id and every persistent
    buffer on ``_trace_state``. Device lifecycle remains owned by the caller (the
    runner never calls ``ttnn.close_device``).
