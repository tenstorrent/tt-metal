# Yolov8s-World

### Platforms:

Wormhole N150, N300

**Note:** On N300, make sure to use `WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml` with the pytest.

Or, make sure to set the following environment variable in the terminal:
```
export WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml
```

To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with following command:
```
./build_metal.sh -p
```
### Introduction:

The YOLO-World Model introduces an advanced, real-time Ultralytics YOLOv8-based approach for Open-Vocabulary Detection tasks. This innovation enables the detection of any object within an image based on descriptive texts. By significantly lowering computational demands while preserving competitive performance, YOLO-World emerges as a versatile tool for numerous vision-based applications.

### Details:
- The entry point to yolov8s_world model is TtYOLOWorld in `models/demos/yolov8s_world/tt/ttnn_yolov8s_world.py`.
- The model picks up certain configs and weights from Ultralytics pretrained model. We've used weights available [here](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/#available-models-supported-tasks-and-operating-modes) in YOLOv8s-world row.
- Batch size :1
- Supported Input Resolution - (640,640) (Height,Width)
- Dataset used for evaluation - **coco-2017**

### How to Run:

Use the following command to run the model :
```
pytest --disable-warnings tests/ttnn/integration_tests/yolov8s_world/test_ttnn_yolov8s_world.py::test_YoloModel
```
### Performant Model with Trace+2CQ
- end-2-end perf is 57 FPS

Use the following command to run the performant Model with Trace+2CQs:

```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov8s_world/tests/test_e2e_performant.py::test_e2e_performant
```

### Performant Demo with Trace+2CQ
Use the following command to run the performant Demo with Trace+2CQs:

```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/yolov8s_world/demo/demo.py
```

### Performant evaluation with Trace+2CQ
Use the following command to run the performant evaluation with Trace+2CQs:

```
pytest models/experimental/yolo_evaluation/yolo_common_evaluation.py::test_yolov8s_world[res0-device_params0-tt_model]
```
Note: The model is evaluated with 500 samples.
