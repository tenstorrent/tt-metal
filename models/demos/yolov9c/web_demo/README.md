# Yolov9c Web Demo

## How to run the web demo

### Server side:

- ssh into the server specifying the port:
  ```
  ssh -L 7000:localhost:7000 user@IP.ADDRESS
  ```

- After building metal, once you activate your python env. pip install the requirements on the server side:
  ```
  pip install -r models/demos/yolov9c/web_demo/server/requirements.txt
  ```

- After installing the server side requirments, ONLY if you are running the demo on an N300 card,run the following to export the approprite envirement variable for N300.
  ```
  export WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml
  ```

– Run the following command on the server to execute the Yolov9c model for the DETECTION task:
  ```
  source models/demos/yolov9c/web_demo/server/run_uvicorn_detection.sh
  ```

– Run the following command on the server to execute the Yolov9c model for the
SEGMENTATION task:

  ```
  source models/demos/yolov9c/web_demo/server/run_uvicorn_segmentation.sh
  ```

### Client side:

- git clone metal repo locally/on client side as well.
  ```
  cd models/demos/yolov9c/web_demo/client
  ```
- you may create a python virtual env and pip install the client side requirements.

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Run the following command on the client to execute the Yolov9c model for the DETECTION task:
  ```
  source run_on_client_YOLOv9c_Detection_Metal --api-url http://IP.ADDRESS:7000
  ```

  Run the following command on the client to execute the Yolov9c model for the SEGMENTATION task:
  ```
  source run_on_client_YOLOv9c_Segmentation_Metal --api-url http://IP.ADDRESS:7000
  ```

- a browser should automatically open and you will see the live object detection demo using your local camera.
