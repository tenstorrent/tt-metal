## (RESOLVED 2026-10-15 by the supervisor) The canonical prompt is shorter than the scaled rung

Resolved 2026-10-15 by the supervisor: `scaled.ladder` is now 55296 tokens in 2048-token chunks, within the existing
prompt (56320 tokens); no prompt rebuild.

The alternatives that were open before the resolution (both outside SG.1's paths): set spec `text.length: 65536` and
rebuild the prompt (`prompt.build(force=True)`; ids stay prefix-identical, new sha), or make `prompt.default_length`
count `scaled.ladder` as well as the real ladder rungs.

(Moved here from the bullet in C.swa.kv test attempt 2: the RESOLVED note pushed the bullet past 600 characters.)
