# Bert-Tiny

## Platforms:
    Grayskull (e150), Wormhole (n150, n300)

## Introduction
BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.

## Prerequisites
- Cloned [tt-metal repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal) for source code
- Installed: [TT-Metalium™ / TT-NN™](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)

## How to Run
- Run the demo:
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/bert_tiny/demo/demo.py::test_demo[models/demos/bert_tiny/demo/input_data.json-mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-squadv2-128-8-device_params0]
```

- If you wish to run the demo with a different input use:
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/bert_tiny/demo/demo.py::test_demo[<address_to_your_json_file.json>-mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-squadv2-128-8-device_params0]
```
This file is expected to have exactly 8 inputs.

- Our second demo is designed to run SQuADV2 dataset, run this with:
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/bert_tiny/demo/demo.py::test_demo_squadv2[1-mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-squadv2-384-8-device_params0]
```

- If you wish to run for `n_iterations` samples, use:
```
pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/bert_tiny/demo/demo.py::test_demo_squadv2[<n_iterations>-mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-squadv2-384-8-device_params0]
```

# Details
- The entry point to  bert model is bert_for_question_answering in `models/demos/bert_tiny/tt/bert_tiny.py`. The model picks up certain configs and weights from huggingface pretrained model. We have used `mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-squadv2` version from huggingface as our reference.

# Inputs
- Inputs by default are provided from `input_data.json`. If you wish you to change the inputs, provide a different path to test_demo.
- We do not recommend modifying `input_data.json` file.
