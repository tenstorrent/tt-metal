# TT multichip deepseek v3.2 MLA

## Goal
Implement deepseek v3.2 MLA layer for multichip TT setup. Start from existing v3 and introduce changes.
Identify missing ttnn operations.
Identify problems and what needs to be updated/changed.

## Scope
Prefill only.
MLA layer.

## Agreements
1. **Start from the existing v3 op and modify it**.
2. Keep track of issues and learning points.
3. K cache stays in the same format so that it doesn't affect decode downstream.
4. ~~TopK needs Row-major input.~~ CORRECTED 2026-06-10: ttnn.topk asserts TILE input (topk_device_operation.cpp:152), verified on Blackhole.
5. PCC truth is the CPU reference (reference_cpu), not v3 — v3.2 output is not assumed to match v3.
6. Weights: start from random initialization, move to pretrained later. Pretrained MLA loading already exists in reference_cpu; torch→ttnn conversion + sharding exists in v3 (_convert_and_cache_weights / build_ttnn_cache) and is reused.
7. Always follow tensor shapes — document the shape (and sharding) of every input/output/intermediate; CPU reference shapes are normative.
8. APIs for missing ops are derived from the fused-op reports in context/ (DeepGEMM fp8_mqa_logits for indexer, FlashMLA sparse attention) + composing existing ttnn ops, per "Approach to missing ops".
9. Every decision is documented here before/while implementing — keeps implementation unblocked and reviewable async.
10. Test-first whenever possible. For a missing op the first test checks shapes (op API runs end-to-end with the agreed input/output shapes); numerics vs CPU reference come after.
11. Target hardware: QuietBox, 4 Blackhole devices. Tests parametrized by mesh shape so Galaxy works later — no hardcoded 4-device assumptions.
12. Parallelism and sharding follow v3 decisions exactly. Any deviation forced by v3.2 is documented here. CPU reference is single-device truth only — it says nothing about distribution.
13. Mesh bring-up order: start 1x4 (pure TP, matches spec-multichip TP-only plan); add 2x2 (SP x TP, exercises chunked path) later. Both stay parametrized.
14. Scale bring-up order: small single-shot first (~4-8k tokens, cheap CPU reference); 50k cache + 5k chunk later as gating milestone with cached CPU outputs.
15. Chunk size is a configurable test parameter, 1k for the dev loop (CPU truth fast enough for iteration); 5k once proper kernels (fused sparse attention) land. Same code path either way.

## Status (updated 2026-06-15)

### ✅ Foundations (pre-port)
- [x] CPU reference (reference_cpu) — MLA + Indexer, matches DeepSeek reference
- [x] Single-chip ttnn port (reference_tt_single_chip) — MLA + Indexer w/ CPU fallbacks; decisions in spec.md, multichip plan in spec-multichip.md
- [x] Multichip scaffold (tt/ + tests/) reusing deepseek_v3_d_p as a library
  - 🧩 tt/mla/mla.py — ttMLA subclass of v3 ttMLA; all DSA changes live here
  - 🧩 tt_prefill_block.py / tt_prefill_transformer.py — v3 copies, only MLA/block import changed (→ backlog 13: upstream injection params, delete copies)

### ✅ Step 1 — test rewire to CPU reference (2026-06-10, 1x4: seq256 0.9991 / seq2k 0.9986, KVPE 0.9999)
- 🧩 Weight map MLACPU→v3 dict is a pure rename (wq_a→q_a_proj, …, wo→o_proj); same [out,in] layout, bf16
- 🧩 Bring-up seq = index_topk(2048): DSA mask is 0 over causal region → MLACPU dense-equivalent, passthrough must match; seq>2048 diverges by design
- 🧩 MLACPU simulate_fp8=False (device KVPE bf16); HF config shape-asserted vs ModelArgs; rope interleaved↔reference proven (spec D5)
- 💾 CPU outputs cached at $DEEPSEEK_V32_MLA_REF_CACHE, keyed tag+seq+seed; seq2k cold 431s
- 🐞 Fixed: ModelArgs.max_seq_len=seq_len disabled YaRN in the CPU ref (mscale² 1.87x drift, PCC 0.78) → keep max_seq_len=16384

### ✅ Step 2 — missing-op APIs (tt/ops.py), shapes + numerics on 1x4
- [x] Shape contracts (test_ops_shapes.py, 5 tests, 8.5s): indexer_logits composed on device; ttnn.topk on device at k=2048 (TILE in); sparse_mla CPU fallback
- [x] Numerics (test_ops_numerics.py vs functional CPU path): indexer_logits PCC ≥0.99, sparse_mla 0.999
- [x] topk index-set overlap vs torch ≥1−max(2/k,1%) per row — bf16 ties swap a small boundary band (11/2048 measured; not a bug)

### ✅ Step 3 — single-shot DSA in v32 ttMLA (2026-06-10, suite 12/12; seq4k 0.9975, sparse rows 0.9948)
- 🧩 `seq ≤ index_topk` → `super().forward` (dense == sparse); `seq > index_topk` → `_dsa_forward` = v3 forward with ring SDPA replaced by `ops.sparse_mla` over top-k latents, `wkv_b2` after attention
- 🖥️ Indexer stems on host (qr from MLA q_a host copy; F1 non-interleaved rope); logits+topk on device. Limit: sp=1 single-shot only (asserted)
- 🧪 e2e seq4k case; indexer weights flow via WEIGHT_NAME_MAP (popped before v3 sees them); band PCC diagnostics kept in test_mla.py
- 🐞 Bugs found & fixed:
  - [x] hidden is TP-sharded → indexer host stems concat shards
  - [x] epilogue is RS-only (RS+AG gave replicated 28672 output)
  - [x] sparse_mla must re-impose causality for rows with <k causal keys (future indices from topk's −inf band) — now op contract
  - [x] CPU truth ran fp8/Hadamard indexer (selection-divergent) → `use_fp8_path=False` per spec §104
  - [x] q head-sharded but sparse_mla read shard 0 + replicated → 3/4 chips wrong heads; now per-shard (q/out TP-sharded, kvpe+indices replicated)
- ⚠️ Gotcha: don't pipe pytest through `tail` — swallows exit code; log to file, check `$?`

### ✅ Step 4 — chunked DSA prefill (2026-06-11, 1x4: 4k cache + 1k chunks, PCC 0.9982, per-chunk ≥0.996; suite 15/15)
- [x] (1) `sparse_mla(start_pos)` causal offset
- [x] (2) host indexer K-cache + chunked `_indexer_topk`
- [x] (3) chunked `_dsa_forward` (v3 `update_padded_kv_cache` write, rope offset, sparse_mla over populated prefix)
- [x] (4) chunked e2e harness (chunk loop + `get_rope_tensors_indexed`; MLACPU decode-branch truth w/ chunk mask, cached per (seq,chunk,seed))
- 📐 Chunk size is a test param (agreement 15): 1k dev; 50k gate postponed (backlog 3); 5k deferred to fused kernels
- 🐞 Bugs found & fixed:
  - [x] dense-passthrough chunks skipped indexer K-cache write → DSA chunks scored against zeros (0.855/0.725 → ≥0.996). **Lesson (3rd occurrence): write EVERY per-chunk cache on every chunk, dense or sparse**
  - [x] ring buffer sized from constructor seq_len = full cache, not chunk
  - [x] MLACPU dense branch out-of-bounds for chunked truth (start_pos>0 → decode branch + chunk mask)
  - [x] bf8 cache quantization ruled out (mirror test); KVPE prefix 0.9999 isolated the fault to selection

### 🔨 Step 5 — 2x2 SP×TP (backlog 4, in progress 2026-06-11)

**Premise:** the 1x4 code already uses v3's **hidden-sharded** residual + TP-per-head stems (RS/AG via `_tp_rs_ag`), i.e. spec-multichip §3.6.1's end-state TP layout — *not* the "replicated sequence" Phase-0. So at sp=1 the TP scheme already matches v3 exactly. 2x2 only **adds the SP (sequence) axis**; authority for the layout is spec-multichip §3.6.1. Mesh stays parametrized (agreement 11/13).

**Distribution vs v3** (per-block; `=` follows v3 exactly, `Δ` v3.2-specific):

| Block | v3 | v32 1x4 (done) | v32 2x2 plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stems wq_a/wkv_a + norms | input-sharded TP, RS/AG | = | = (SP just means fewer tokens/chip; TP RS/AG unchanged) |
| wq_b/wkv_b heads | TP per-head, H/tp local | = | = |
| MLA kvpe cache | SP-sharded seq, TP-replicated | sp=1 (no shard) | **= v3**: reuse init_kvpe_cache/fill/update, SP-shards at sp=2 |
| Attention core | `ring_joint_sdpa` (ring over SP) | `ops.sparse_mla` → `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa` **device op** (Step 6) — Δ DSA needs index mask, no ring-SDPA mask hook (§3.3) | Δ full-T KVPE gathered (replicated) per chip, then on-device sparse attn over q shard |
| Indexer stems | n/a (no indexer in v3) | device, TP input-sharded + AG-reduce (backlog 6) | = TP; + SP |
| Indexer K cache | n/a | host `_index_k_cache` flat | Δ keys are SP-local; gather across SP for scoring |
| indexer_score+topk | n/a | device, full seq (sp=1) | Δ local-Q × full-T keys (after SP gather) → topk |
| o_proj | row-parallel + RS | = | = |

**The only thing 2x2 adds is SP communication on the key axis**, and v3 solves it with `ring_joint_sdpa`/`ring_mla` — which v3.2 can't use (no additive-mask hook for DSA, §3.3). v3.2 first substituted **host SP-gathers** (functional, per "no ttnn op → CPU fallback"); as of Step 6 (2026-06-15) the attention core is the `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa` **device op** run SPMD per chip (no host SDPA). KVPE is still gathered full-T (replicated) rather than SP-ringed in-op — the fully-fused SP-ring sparse-attn (former backlog 12) remains the perf follow-up.

**DECISION (2026-06-11, confirmed): replicate the indexer key cache, keep the MLA KVPE SP-sharded (v3).** Index key is tiny (single head, 128-wide) so full-T replication is cheap (~T·128·2B) and turns the read-time SP gather into a one-shot gather-at-write into the (host) cache — removes distributed-topk entirely. The big MLA KVPE latent stays SP-sharded per v3; sparse_mla gathers selected latents. Deviation from §3.6.1 (which SP-shards the index cache), justified for a functional port; documented per agreement 12.

**Key implementation note — global positions.** Under SP each chip's local tokens map to *non-contiguous* global positions (contiguous sharding: chip sp_i holds global [sp_i·S/sp, …)). So per SP shard the host RoPE freqs offset and the causal-mask triu offset must use the **global** query start (sp_i·local + start_pos), not the local/chunk offset. q and out stay SP-sharded; only keys/latents are gathered full-T.

**Slices (test-first):**
- [x] 5.1 lifted `sp_factor==1` assert; added 2x2 (mesh (2,2)) to single-shot test param; 1x4 regression green (0.9966 unchanged).
- [x] 5.2 indexer: SP all-gather of the stem outputs (k/q/wts) to full-S (device `all_gather_async` over sp_axis) → existing global-contiguous logic runs unchanged on full seq; index cache replicated, full indices replicated. (Simpler than per-shard global-pos: gather makes positions contiguous.)
- [x] 5.3 sparse_mla SP×TP-aware: KVPE SP-gathered full-T in `_dsa_forward`; per (sp_i,tp_j) shard attends local queries (global-pos causality) → reassembled via ShardTensor2dMesh (heads on tp, seq on sp). sp=1 collapses to prior behavior (regression-safe).
- [x] **5.4 e2e PCC vs CPU reference on 2x2 single-shot: seq4k 0.9974 (sparse rows 0.9925, dense 0.9987), KVPE 0.9999 — matches 1x4.** Same cached truth (distribution-agnostic).
- [x] 5.5 **chunked 2x2** — DONE (fix below). chunked 4k+1k 2x2 PCC 0.9970, DSA chunks 0.99. Switched chunked prefix read to v3 `kv_cache_to_host` (SP-aware composer) + KVPE consumed as host (backlog 9 done). chunked-1x4 green (0.9974), but **chunked-2x2 DSA chunks degrade (chunk@2048 0.73, chunk@3072 0.67)** while dense chunks (0.998) + single-shot-2x2 (0.9974) pass. Cause: under SP the `update_padded_kv_cache` write order isn't plain global-contiguous, so `kv_cache_to_host[slot,:end_pos]` feeds `sparse_mla` the wrong latents. Re-guarded; chunked test back to 1x4.
  **ROOT CAUSE (2026-06-11): the chunked KVPE cache is stored BLOCK-CYCLIC across SP** (update_padded_kv_cache distributes slabs over chips), not natural order. v3 handles it: ring_mla reads it in-op (native layout), and the v3 chunked test un-rotates with `blockcyclic_positions` (test_mla.py:741-748, `nat[p]=cache_sr`). My read fed block-cyclic latents to sparse_mla against natural-order indices → wrong selection (DSA chunks 0.73). **Does NOT repro in v3** — purely a v32 omission. Dense chunks passed because they use ring_mla.
  **FIX:** chunked `_dsa_forward` reads cache via `ConcatMesh2dToTensor(dims=(2,1))[:, :1]`, un-rotates with `blockcyclic_positions(sp, chunk_size_global, seq_len_cache)` (`deepseek_v3_d_p/tt/mla/utils.py:118`) → natural-order `kvpe_host[:end_pos]`. Indexer K-cache + single-shot unaffected (natural order already). Test kvpe diagnostic must also un-rotate when 2x2 chunked is re-enabled.

### ✅ Step 6 — device sparse-attention op (2026-06-15, suite green; seq4k 1x4 sparse rows 0.990, out 0.9964)
Merged `pjosipovic/sparse_mla_prefill_ref` → `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa` (Blackhole sparse-MLA prefill kernel; PLAN/WORKLOG + torch ref `reference_cpu/sparse_sdpa_prefill.py`). **`ops.sparse_mla` is no longer a host fallback** — it's a thin wrapper over the op. This is the on-device sparse-attn path that was filed as backlog (8)/(12).
- 🧩 Signature unchanged (drop-in body swap per ops.py contract) → `mla.py` untouched. Body: upload `kvpe_host`→replicated `[1,1,T,576]` device tensor; `q` TILE→ROW_MAJOR; SP-reshard `indices` to match q's seq shard (sp>1 only; sp=1 already aligned); pick a TOPK-dividing `k_chunk_size` (prod 2048→128); run op SPMD across SP×TP (each chip runs the single-chip kernel over its q shard → q's SP(seq)×TP(heads) distribution preserved end-to-end); output ROW_MAJOR→TILE for `wkv_b2`.
- 🧩 **Masking is fully baked into `indices` via the 0xFFFFFFFF sentinel** (`indexer_score` -inf's future cols → `topk_indices` emits sentinel as a contiguous tail). The op does **no causal math**, so the old host fallback's `idx>q_pos` / `idx≥T` masks were redundant and were dropped; `start_pos` is now **vestigial** (signature parity only — matches the torch ref). Op preconditions met by the producer: per-chip H multiple of 32 (128 heads/tp=4=32), indices uint32, sentinels a contiguous tail, every row ≥1 valid key, all valid indices <T.
- 🧪 Tests updated for the op contract: `test_ops_numerics::sparse_mla` h 8→128 (per-chip H≥32), PCC bar 0.999→0.99 (bf16 online-softmax); `test_ops_shapes::sparse_mla` indices→uint32. Validated on Blackhole: ops shapes+numerics (single-shot+chunked) green; `test_v32_mla_vs_cpu_reference[seq4k,1x4]` green (dense rows 0.998, **sparse rows 0.990**, out 0.9964, KVPE 0.9998).
- ⚠️ **Perf debt (re-opens (9)):** the wrapper re-uploads `kvpe_host` to device, so the non-chunked path is again device→host (caller `_dsa_forward`) → host→device (op). Removing it needs a signature change to pass the already-replicated device KVPE tensor — follow-up. Chunked path genuinely needs the host hop (block-cyclic un-rotation).
- ⚠️ 2x2 chunked still guarded to 1x4 (pre-existing 5.5 block-cyclic issue, unrelated to this op).

### ✅ Step 7 — DSA path fully on device (2026-06-16, `-m dev` green; chunked 1x4+2x2 PCC 0.9969, seq4k 1x4+2x2 green)
Removed the last host hops so DSA prefill runs end-to-end on device — backlog (9) **done**, indices reshard on device.
- 🧩 **KVPE prefix gather on device** — `mla.py` `_gather_kvpe_prefix` + `_unrotate_blockcyclic`, replacing the
  `ConcatMesh2dToTensor`/`to_torch` + host `blockcyclic_positions` un-rotate + `from_torch` re-upload:
  - single-shot: SP `all_gather` of the live kvpe + `to_layout(ROW_MAJOR)`;
  - chunked: `to_memory_config` ND_SHARDED→INTERLEAVED + SP `all_gather` (no-op at sp=1) + `typecast` bf8→bf16 +
    `to_layout` TILE→RM + on-device block-cyclic→natural un-rotate (`reshape`/`permute`, inverse of `blockcyclic_positions`)
    + trim to `end_pos`. `all_gather` physically concatenates the per-chip cache buffers regardless of the cache's
    Replicate mesh-metadata; the op input is bit-identical to the old host build, so numerics are unchanged.
  - `ops.sparse_mla` now takes the already-replicated **device** kvpe tensor (no `from_torch`); intermediates deallocated.
- 🧩 **Indices SP-reshard on device** via `ttnn.mesh_partition(dim=2, cluster_axis=sp_axis)` (the inverse of `all_gather`),
  replacing `_to_host` + `from_torch`/`ShardTensor2dMesh`. `_to_host` retained as a test/diagnostic readback helper only;
  `tt/ops.py` is now torch-free.
- 🧪 Validated on Blackhole (truth cached): ops shapes/numerics, indexer-chunked, determinism (bit-exact),
  `test_v32_mla_vs_cpu_reference[seq4k]` 1x4+2x2, `test_v32_mla_chunked_vs_cpu_reference` **1x4+2x2** (chunked out PCC 0.9969)
  — full `-m dev` green (13/13). The on-device un-rotate **unblocked 2x2 chunked** (the 5.5 host block-cyclic read is gone).
- ⚠️ Perf debt remains (not correctness): the gather still materializes the full-T replica per chip; the SP-ring +
  full device-residency that avoids it is the (12) C++ follow-up. Design in `context/kvpe_sparse_pipeline_report.html`.
- 🧩 Two incremental commits on `mvasilijevic/dsa_w_ops`: on-device KVPE gather; on-device indices reshard.

### CPU fallbacks (multichip) — running list
**All host fallbacks are gone — the DSA path is fully on device** (indexer backlog (19); KVPE gather + indices reshard Step 7).
No tensor leaves the device during DSA prefill.
| id | fallback | where | status / SP behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~F-rope~~ | ~~non-interleaved RoPE on host (issue #4)~~ | indexer pe slices | **RESOLVED by (19): `_device_rope_pe` → `ttnn.experimental.rotary_embedding_hf` on device (issue #4 resolved); no host RoPE** |
| ~~F-sparse~~ | ~~sparse_mla gather+SDPA on host (backlog 8)~~ | `ops.sparse_mla` | **RESOLVED 2026-06-15 (Step 6): now `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa` device op, no host SDPA** |
| ~~F-mla-prefix~~ | ~~MLA KVPE host readback (backlog 9)~~ | `_dsa_forward` | **RESOLVED 2026-06-16 (Step 7): `_gather_kvpe_prefix` gathers + un-rotates the prefix on device; `ops.sparse_mla` takes the device tensor. No `to_torch`/`from_torch`.** |
| ~~F-idx-reshard~~ | ~~indices replicate→shard via host (sp>1)~~ | `ops.sparse_mla` | **RESOLVED 2026-06-16 (Step 7): `ttnn.mesh_partition` on device (inverse of all_gather); no `_to_host`.** |
| ~~F-idx-key~~ | ~~indexer key SP-gather (2x2)~~ | `_indexer_topk` | **RESOLVED by (19): index key cache is the device tensor `_index_kbuf` (natural order, grown by `ttnn.concat`); no host AG** |

Open work tracked in the Backlog section below.

## Backlog (execution order; numbers are stable cross-refs)

Legend: `[x]` done · `[~]` partial · `[ ]` open · ⏸️ postponed · 📌 resolved as decision (no code).

### Recommended implementation order (open items, updated 2026-06-15)

Done: (4),(5),(6),(7),**(9, Step 7)**,(11),(18),(19). **(8) superseded by the device op** (Step 6). **(9) done** (Step 7, 2026-06-16): the KVPE gather + indices reshard are on device, so **the whole DSA path is on device**. **(12)** core delivered by `sparse_sdpa`; what remains of (12) is **perf only** — an SP-ring that reads the cache natively and avoids the full-T replica (the gather itself is now on device). Remaining open:

`14 → 13 → 16 → 3 → 12(SP-ring perf) → 15 → 20`

| # | Item | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| 14 | v32 tests in CI | locks regressions (long CPU-truths gated); (18) determinism tests already in place |
| 13 | upstream injection → v3, delete copies | independent hygiene; kills drift from copied files |
| 16 | multi-layer / multi-user cache | functional scope expansion toward the full model |
| 3 ⏸️ | 50k scale gate | hardware-time gated; pre-cache truth on a big box |
| 12 | **SP-ring tail of sparse attn (perf)** | per-query gather+SDPA **DONE** via `sparse_sdpa` (Step 6); KVPE gather now on device (Step 7); only the SP-ring that avoids the full-T replica remains — C++ follow-up |
| 15 | decode path | beyond current prefill-only scope; largest expansion |
| 20 | **KV migration for DSA (disaggregated prefill→decode)** | DSA path drops the migration ack/zero-pad and the indexer cache isn't in the address table; couples to (15)/(16), cleanest after (12) device-residency. See cache_report.html §12 |

**The MLA-layer milestone is complete and fully on device** (1x4+2x2, single-shot+chunked, random+pretrained; sparse attention a device op; KVPE gather + indices reshard on device — Step 7). What remains is hygiene (14/13), scope expansion (16/15), and perf (the SP-ring tail of 12) — none blocking functional correctness.

**Step 4 — chunked prefill**
- [x] **(1)** MLACPU decode branch accepts intra-chunk causal mask (was mask=None → no within-chunk causality)
- [x] **(2)** chunked e2e harness (chunk loop, get_rope_tensors_indexed, chunked ttMLA); slice-3 wiring tested at 4k+1k
- [ ] ⏸️ **(3)** scale gate 50k cache + 1k chunks overnight (cached truth); 5k once fused kernels land (agreement 15)

**Functional gaps (blocking production)**
- [x] **(4)** 2x2 SP×TP mesh — **DONE** (single-shot + chunked, 1x4 + 2x2). Indexer stems SP-all-gathered, index cache replicated, MLA KVPE SP-sharded; sparse_mla SP×TP-aware. 5.5 chunked+SP fixed via block-cyclic un-rotation (`blockcyclic_positions`) of the cache read. seq4k single-shot 2x2 0.9974; chunked 4k+1k 2x2 0.9970 (DSA chunks 0.99).
- [x] **(5)** pretrained weights — test knobs (conftest `--ds-layer` / `--ds-checkpoint` / `--ds-repo` / `--ds-input`); `build_cpu_reference(layer, checkpoint_path, repo)` loads a specific MLA+indexer layer via reference_cpu `initialize_weights`; `make_hidden(--ds-input)` injects file-driven input (chunked + indexer tests; single-shot uses v3 harness input). ref-cache keyed by weight source. **Validated on real layer-0 weights: seq256 (dense) output PCC 0.9997; seq4k (DSA active) output 0.9996, sparse rows 0.9994, KVPE 0.9999** — full path HF download → fp8 dequant → weight map → PCC. DSA on trained weights ≈ random or slightly better (sharper top-k selection).
- [x] **(6)** device-side indexer stems — wq_b/wk/weights_proj GEMMs + k_norm (LayerNorm) + TP all-reduce on device, replicated across TP; wk/weights_proj sharded on the `dim` contraction axis (per-chip partials → `_tp_rs_ag`); qr reuses the v3 q_a stem. Only non-interleaved RoPE stays on host (F1, pe slices read back per chunk). Eliminates the per-chunk full-hidden readback + host GEMMs. Validated 1x4: indexer chunked==single-shot selection green; seq4k e2e PCC 0.9966 (was 0.9975 host — `weights_proj` fp32→bf16 cost, within 0.98 threshold). Test needs FABRIC_1D now (device CCL). Follow-ups → backlog 9/10 (device K-cache, drop pe readback), 4 (2x2)
- [x] 📌 **(7)** fp8/Hadamard parity — follow v3 cache format (kvpe bfloat8_b); ttnn has no matching fp8, so the functional path is the contract; truth stays use_fp8_path=False/simulate_fp8=False

**Host fallbacks → device ops (perf debt; contracts in tt/ops.py + Missing op APIs)**
- [x] **(8)** sparse_mla gather+SDPA → device — **DONE 2026-06-15 via `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa`** (merged `pjosipovic/sparse_mla_prefill_ref`; Step 6). The 2026-06-11 "RETIRED, don't compose it" decision below was correct *for a composed workaround* — the actual resolution is the fused C++ kernel (what (8) wanted all along, written directly rather than composed). `ops.sparse_mla` now wraps it; the host fallback is gone. Historical rationale kept for context:
  - A composed device version is *feasible* (query-tile to bound `sel=[Sq,k,576]`, ~9.6 GB full → ~0.6 GB at tile=256 via `ttnn.embedding` gather, verified), but **not worth it**: (a) no correctness gain (host fallback already PCC 0.997); (b) the real win is **fusion** (never materialize `sel`, stream over `k`) which a composed op *by definition cannot do*; (c) per-tile ROW_MAJOR↔TILE churn + many small batched matmuls over k=2048 may be net-slower than host; (d) perf is out of scope (spec §3, Approach §4).
  - SP only gives ~sp× (2×), already captured by query-sharding in (4). The order-of-magnitude relief is fusion, independent of SP — only the kernel delivers it. So there is **no composed workaround**; → folded into (12).
  - Probe kept as design input for (12): row-gather primitive = `ttnn.embedding` (weight [T,576] RM + flat idx → [Sq·k,576]); `ttnn.gather` needs prohibitive input expansion.
- [x] **(9)** MLA cache-slot host readback — **DONE 2026-06-16 (Step 7).** `_dsa_forward` builds the sparse op's KVPE input fully on device: single-shot = SP `all_gather` + `to_layout`; chunked = `_gather_kvpe_prefix` (`to_memory_config` ND→INTER + SP `all_gather` + `typecast` + `to_layout` + on-device block-cyclic un-rotate). `ops.sparse_mla` takes the device tensor (no `from_torch`). The "chunked host hop is irreducible" note was wrong — the block-cyclic un-rotate is a tile-aligned `reshape`/`permute` on device. Validated 1x4+2x2 (chunked PCC 0.9969).
- [x] **(10)** ~~indexer host stems readback (full hidden concat per chunk)~~ — resolved by (6); only the pe-slice RoPE readback remains, folded into (6)'s F1 host-rope note (coupled to issue #4)
- [x] **(19)** indexer key cache → device + on-device indexer RoPE — **DONE 2026-06-11. The indexer is now fully on-device: stems, RoPE, key cache, logits, topk — zero host.**
  - On-device RoPE: `_device_rope_pe` uses `rotary_embedding_hf` with precomputed device cos/sin (`_build_index_rope_tables`, halves-repeated, sliced per chunk to global positions). Replaces host `_host_rope_pe` — removes the q/k readbacks (the dominant indexer host transfer).
  - Device index-key cache: `_index_kbuf`, replicated, **natural order, grown by `ttnn.concat`** per chunk (avoids the block-cyclic write-primitive question entirely; reset at start_pos==0). No un-permute needed (op gives natural order).
  - q reshaped to heads on device via `nlp_create_qkv_heads`; mask still host-built+uploaded (small, out of (19)).
  - Validated: indexer chunked==single-shot consistency green; e2e seq4k 1x4 0.9966 / 2x2 0.9974 / chunked 2x2 0.9970 — unchanged from host-rope (rope PCC was 0.99999). Removed dead `_index_k_cache`/`_kvpe_mirror`/`_host_rope_pe`/`apply_rotary_emb`.

**Fused C++ ops (out of scope per Approach §4, documented follow-ups)**
- [x] **(11)** indexer_logits → **fused op landed 2026-06-12.** Merged `skrstic/dsa_indexer_score_op_2` (`ttnn.experimental.indexer_score`) + `pjosipovic/topk_xl` (`ttnn.experimental.topk_large_indices`); `tt/ops.py` now wraps both instead of composing.
  - `indexer_score(q [1,Hi,Sq,D], k [1,1,T,D], weights [1,Hi,Sq,1], is_causal, chunk_start_idx)` → score [1,1,Sq,T] **bf16 ROW_MAJOR, causality FUSED** (future cols -inf from `chunk_start_idx`). So `_indexer_topk` dropped the host triu-mask add; `indexer_logits` permutes the `[1,1,Sq,Hi]` weights_proj output to the op's `[1,Hi,Sq,1]`.
  - `topk_large_indices(logits, k)` (Blackhole-only) chains directly off the row-major bf16 score → ROW_MAJOR uint32 indices. k∈[16,2048], multiple of 16 (active path k=index_topk=2048). -inf columns survive as the **sentinel index 0xFFFFFFFF** (contiguous tail, descending sort). As of Step 6 the consumer is the `sparse_sdpa` device op, which masks those slots itself from the sentinel — `sparse_mla` no longer clamps/drops indices in Python (that host logic was removed). bf16 (no fp8/Hadamard) still the contract.
  - ✅ **topk_large_indices index-drop bug — DIAGNOSED then FIXED 2026-06-12.** Symptom: on inputs containing **+0.0** the op dropped genuine top-k indices and duplicated the window-base index 0. Isolation localized it to the LLK **index carry** (`_topk_xl_add_lsb_indices_`/compare-exchange), NOT the cross-window merge and NOT data movement — proven by: reproduces at minimal **1 row, n=k=512, single window** (merge never runs, output must be a permutation 0..511); 512 strictly-distinct shuffled values → perfect (not ordering); `ttnn.add(t,0)` bit-exact (not movement); all-equal/two-valued → perfect (the trigger is +0.0, which also ties). Repro `context/repro_topk_minimal.py` (BUG + negative control + torch/input self-check); writeup `context/BUG_topk_large_indices_dups.md`.
  - **Fix landed in `pjosipovic/topk_xl` (53144ada029 "Fix topk_large_indices zero tie indices"), merged here (f0067b3e91e).** Mechanism confirmed the diagnosis: the fused word packs the bf16 value in bits[31:16] and the index in bits[15:0]; for +0.0 that word is an FP32 **subnormal** which `SFPSWAP` canonicalizes back to +0.0, **erasing the index** → 0. Fix substitutes a tiny negative-normal surrogate for +0.0 internally (`_topk_xl_promote_positive_zero_for_fused_index_`). Rebuilt + verified: pjosipovic ties test PASSES; minimal repro 512/512 (was 506); **op dev suite 10/10 green incl. `test_topk_indices_match[k2048]`** (the former RED sentinel). The -inf→0xFFFFFFFF causal sentinel is a separate, still-valid feature; `sparse_mla`'s clamp + index≥T handling stays. (Prior to this, the 2026-06-12 force-push cd4ad317678 was a rebase + cosmetic cleanup that added the failing ties regression test but not the fix.)
- [~] **(12)** **fused sparse attention** — single-chip core **DONE 2026-06-15: `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa`** (merged `pjosipovic/sparse_mla_prefill_ref`). One kernel, per-query gather of k selected latents + flash/online-softmax SDPA (no `sel` materialization) + DSA mask baked into the 0xFFFFFFFF index sentinel; H any multiple of tile height, k_chunk-blocked over the key axis. Blackhole-only, fp32_dest_acc disabled. **Remaining (perf only):** the gather/un-rotate is now on device (Step 7, (9) done), but it still materializes the full-T replica per chip; an SP-ring over the latent cache (read it natively, ring across SP, gather only the selected k — like v3 `ring_mla`) would avoid that. C++ follow-up; design in `context/kvpe_sparse_pipeline_report.html`.

- [ ] **(21)** **indexer perf — TP-shard the 64 heads + all-reduce the partial logits** (next step after the HB=16 config, commit `5c250a95f40`). **Why:** `_indexer_topk` runs `indexer_score` **replicated at all 64 heads**, so it can't keep heads L1-resident — the full-model config is forced to `HB=16` (head-streamed, the "slow but safe" path). Measured on SP4×TP2 chunked DSA (5120 q × 56320 k): the indexer is **802 ms = 95.7%** of the layer at **~1.85% matmul util**, vs the op's **76%** at its intended 16-head `HB=0` deployment — a ~40× gap. **Plan:** TP-shard the heads (64 → 16/device at TP=4) so each chip's `indexer_score` emits a *partial* logit (the head-sum is separable; `relu` is per-head and the `−inf` causal mask is head-independent, so it survives), then **all-reduce(SUM)** the partials over `tp_axis` before top-k. Enables `HB=0` (≈76% util → indexer ~20 ms/chip est.). **Edits:** col-parallel `wq_b` (shard `H_idx·D_idx` output → no reduce, q-latent already replicated), slice this rank's 16 head-weights from `weights_proj`, keep the **key** SP-gather (MQA keys are head-independent), add the logits all-reduce. **Cost to confirm:** the all-reduce of the full `[1,1,glob,end_pos]` logits (~580 MB at the §7 scale) — must stay below the ~782 ms of compute it removes (very likely, but measure). **Caveat:** TP=1 has no head split → stays on `HB=16`. Full design in `INDEXER_OP.md` ("head residency").

**Hygiene**
- [ ] **(13)** upstream mla_class/block_class injection to v3 → delete the two copied files
- [ ] **(14)** v32 tests in CI
- [ ] **(15)** decode path
- [ ] **(16)** multi-layer / multi-user cache
- [ ] **(17)** replicated-vs-sharded mask dedup
- [x] **(18)** determinism tests — `test_v32_mla_determinism` (seq4k, 1x4 + 2x2, 3 runs each, no CPU truth). **Bit-exact: exact=True, PCC=1.0** run-to-run on both meshes — the DSA path (CCL reductions, sparse_sdpa op, topk) is fully deterministic. Asserts torch.equal + PCC≥0.9999.
- [ ] **(20)** KV migration (disaggregated prefill→decode) for the DSA path. **Background:** migration is *not* a ttnn op — it's out-of-band NoC reads by an external `migration_worker`, driven by a `KvChunkAddressTable` (built host-side from the live cache layout, `utils/kv_cache_utils.py:21 create_kv_chunk_address_table_ds`; one entry per `(layer, 32-tok pos, slot)` → `noc_addr=(bank<<32)|(base+off)`, round-robin over 8 DRAM banks, chunk=`[1,1,32,576]` bf8 = 19584 B) + a per-layer ack (`InterProcessCounterChannel.inject(1)`). The v3 on-device contribution is just `update_padded_kv_cache` → `zero_padded_kv_cache` (zero the pad window to the next 128-boundary) → `synchronize_device` → `on_layer_complete(layer)` — **chunked path only** (`deepseek_v3_d_p/tt/mla/mla.py:536-567`); single-shot has no per-layer stream (wholesale copy). **Gaps in v3.2:** (i) `_dsa_forward` swallows `on_layer_complete`/`actual_isl` in `**_` (`tt/mla/mla.py:253-262`) → never zero-pads or acks; only the dense passthrough (super().forward → v3 chunked) migrates. (ii) the two v3.2-only structures are **absent from the address table**: the indexer key cache (`_index_kbuf`, replicated, grown by concat) and the host KVPE readback. **Work:** (a) thread `on_layer_complete`+`actual_isl` through `_dsa_forward` and call `zero_padded_kv_cache`+ack like v3 `_chunked_attn` (the MLA latent cache is the same `kvpe_cache` as v3, so it is already address-table-mappable — only the ack is missing); (b) extend `create_kv_chunk_address_table_ds` to map the **indexer key cache** `_index_kbuf` (replicated → ship one replica), the genuinely new structure; (c) decode-side layout/policy for the indexer cache. Couples to (15) decode + (16) multi-user cache. See `context/cache_report.html` §12.

## Issues
1. ~~No fused indexing op in ttnn~~ RESOLVED 2026-06-12: `ttnn.experimental.indexer_score` merged (fused causal mask, bf16; no fp8/Hadamard yet). tt/ops.py::indexer_logits now wraps it. See backlog (11).
2. ~~ttnn.topk k=2048 untested~~ RESOLVED 2026-06-10 (worked at k=2048); SUPERSEDED 2026-06-12 by `ttnn.experimental.topk_large_indices` (Blackhole-only, ROW_MAJOR bf16 in, uint32 out, 0xFFFFFFFF sentinel for -inf). tt/ops.py::topk_indices wraps it.
3. ~~No sparse attention in ttnn — CPU fallback in tt/ops.py::sparse_mla~~ RESOLVED 2026-06-15: `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa` merged (Blackhole sparse-MLA prefill; masking baked into the 0xFFFFFFFF index sentinel, no causal math in-op). tt/ops.py::sparse_mla now wraps it (signature unchanged; `start_pos` vestigial). See backlog (8)/(12) and Step 6.
4. ~~Missing non-interleaved RoPE op~~ — **RESOLVED by investigation 2026-06-11: ttnn HAS native non-interleaved (rotate_half) RoPE ops.** No permutation wrapper and no kernel change needed (the earlier "bake P into the trans_mat" plan is moot).
   - **`ttnn.experimental.rotary_embedding_hf`** — dedicated HF-format (rotate_half) RoPE; caller-supplied cos/sin; `is_decode_mode` flag; TILE (decode also RM); head_dim 64 fits (two 32-tiles, split at 32). **Primary candidate.**
   - `ttnn.experimental.rotary_embedding` — also rotate_half, caller cos/sin, `token_index` for decode. Secondary.
   - `ttnn.experimental.rotate_half` — the bare rotate_half tensor op, for custom pipelines.
   - Why this works where `rotary_embedding_llama` can't: llama uses a per-tile [32,32] trans_mat → can only pair *within* a tile (interleaved); the rotate_half ops pair across the 32-split (i, i+32) natively. So the cross-tile pairing is handled inside these ops.
   - **PROBE CONFIRMED 2026-06-11: PCC 0.99999** vs reference `apply_rotary_emb(interleaved=False)` on a [1,H,128,64] slice. Recipe: x prefill layout `[1, H, S, 64]`; cos/sin `[1,1,S,64]` = `cat([freqs.real, freqs.real], -1)` / `cat([freqs.imag, freqs.imag], -1)` (halves repeated, from `precompute_freqs_cis`); `ttnn.experimental.rotary_embedding_hf(x, cos, sin, is_decode_mode=False, compute_kernel_config=HiFi4/fp32_acc)`. head_dim 64 OK (divisible by 2·TILE).
   - So on-device indexer RoPE is in-scope and trivial (drop-in for the host `_host_rope_pe`): removes the q/k pe-slice readbacks (the dominant indexer host transfer) and unblocks (19). No C++.
5. v3 composition files hardcode ttMLA/TtPrefillBlock — forced copies in v32; fix by upstreaming injection params (tt/README.md)
6. V3.2 checkpoints (indexer weights) not wired into test conftest — tests run with v3 weights

### Missing op APIs (proposed 2026-06-10, step 2 — review async)
ttnn-shaped equivalents of the fused references (DeepGEMM fp8_mqa_logits, FlashMLA sparse fwd). All activations [1, B, S_local, ·] TILE bf16 like v3; indexer replicated across TP, S sharded on SP (spec-multichip §3.6). B=1 prefill.

1. `indexer_logits(q, k, w) -> logits` — q [1,B,Sq,H_idx*D_idx] (H=64, D=128), k [1,B,Skv,D_idx], w [1,B,Sq,H_idx] (fp32 weights_proj out). Out [1,B,Sq,Skv] bf16 (fp8 inputs later). Causal window per row (DeepGEMM ks/ke), no materialized mask. Workaround: per-head matmul + ReLU + weighted head-sum + causal mask add. CPU fallback for non-interleaved rope (F1).
2. `topk_indices(logits, k=2048) -> indices` — TILE in (corrected agreement 4), out [1,B,Sq,k] uint32, padded with last valid where Skv<k. Workaround: ttnn.topk; host fallback. K cache format untouched (agreement 3).
3. `sparse_mla(q, kvpe_cache, indices, scale) -> out` — q [1,H,Sq,576] absorbed; kvpe [1,1,Skv,576]; indices [1,B,Sq,2048]; out [1,H,Sq,512]; indices replace causal mask (FlashMLA contract). **DELIVERED 2026-06-15 as `ttnn.transformer.sparse_sdpa(q, kv, indices, v_dim, scale, k_chunk_size)`** (ROW_MAJOR bf16/bf16/uint32 in, ROW_MAJOR bf16 out; per-chip H multiple of 32; k_chunk_size multiple of 32 dividing TOPK). **API learning (e2e seq4k, PCC 0.20→fixed):** rows with <k causal keys receive arbitrary future indices from topk's -inf band. **Resolution in the shipped op:** masking is the producer's job — `indexer_score` -inf's future cols and `topk_indices` emits the 0xFFFFFFFF sentinel (contiguous tail); the op masks those, does **no** position/causal math, and **ignores `start_pos`** (the old host fallback's index>row_pos drop is gone, was redundant). Producer preconditions: sentinels a contiguous tail, every row ≥1 valid key, valid indices <T.

Shape tests are the first deliverable per op; numerics vs reference_cpu after.

### Approach to missing ops
When no op exist try to **0. define an API (inputs/outputs)** and
1. create a workaround by composing existing ops
2. fallback to CPU implementation
3. implement stub op that emits a warning and returns random/zeroes/ones tensor in the expected format.
4. Proper implementation of c++ ops is out of scope. That's follow-up that should be documented.

## Dev loop
The inner cycle = edit → run **one targeted test** → read PCC. Measured this session (QuietBox 1x4/2x2). Optimize this, not the suite.

**Test groups (pytest markers, registered in tests/conftest.py):**
- `-m dev` (13 tests, ~1 min, no cold CPU truth): ops shapes+numerics, indexer self-consistency, seq256 e2e (both meshes). **Per-edit.**
- `-m gate` (10 tests, ~10–15 min, CPU truths must be cached): full `vs_cpu_reference` matrix (3 seq × 2 mesh) + chunked (2 mesh) + determinism. **Pre-commit / CI.** (seq256 carries both `dev` and `gate`.)
- `-m nightly` (none yet): cold-truth builds + 50k scale gate (backlog 3) — big-box only.
- CI = `-m "dev or gate"` after a truth-prime step; the test asserts no cold CPU-truth compute under CI (→ backlog 14). Sets up most of (14).

| Stage | Time | Lever |
|---|---|---|
| mesh open + fabric init + teardown | ~5–9 s / case | fixed per parametrized case; session-scoped device would amortize but v3 conftest opens/closes per case |
| weight upload + ttMLA build | ~2–6 s | reuses v3 build; small |
| cached CPU truth load | <1 s | disk cache — the key enabler |
| **cold CPU truth (first time only)** | **seq2k ~7 min, seq4k ~48 min (quadratic in seq)** | **dominates a cold run; cache once then reuse. 50k+ infeasible cold → pre-cache on a big box** |
| device forward (truth cached) | seq256 ~15s · seq2k ~30s · seq4k ~12–55s · chunked 4k+1k ~35s | real per-iter cost once cached |
| **targeted single case** | **~1–2 min** | **the dev-loop unit — iterate here** |
| full suite (both meshes, all seqs) | ~10–15 min | commit gate, not per-edit |
| pre-commit hooks (black/isort/EOF) | ~20–40 s, often 2× (reformat → re-commit) | keep index clean; expect one reformat re-run |
| ttnn rebuild (after rebase/pull or new C++ op) | ~1–3 min | **`./build_metal.sh`** — its `Install the project…` step refreshes the imported `ttnn/ttnn/_ttnn.so`. `cmake --build build --target ttnn` alone only updates `build_Release/ttnn/_ttnn.so` (NOT the source-tree copy Python loads) → new ops stay invisible |

**Levers, in priority:** (1) cache CPU truth aggressively [done] + pre-cache 50k once; (2) iterate on ONE case (~1–2 min), suite only as gate; (3) keep the band/per-chunk PCC diagnostics — they cost ~nothing and localize bugs fast (they caught the head-shard + block-cyclic bugs); (4) untapped: session-scoped mesh to amortize the ~5–9s × N setup (couples to v3 conftest — defer).

## Long-running tasks
Track every step that takes minutes — each is either a bug risk (silent hangs, stale state) or a caching/optimization opportunity. Add measured times as we collect them.

| Task | When | Time | Mitigation / caching |
|---|---|---|---|
| First e2e MLA test run (mesh init + fabric + weight upload, no output until end) | every fresh pytest | measured: 472s seq2k (cold CPU ref incl.), ~40s seq256 | pytest -s for live progress; track time per stage; weight cache reuses v3 build_ttnn_cache |
| CPU reference forward (uncached) | per (tag, seq, seed); 128 heads + 64-head indexer | measured: ~7 min seq2k, 48 min seq4k — quadratic; 50k+5k infeasible cold | disk cache /tmp/deepseek_v32_mla_ref_cache (env DEEPSEEK_V32_MLA_REF_CACHE) — keep tag/seed stable; 50k+5k truth must be cached once on a big box |
| ttnn incremental rebuild after .so staleness / new C++ op | after rebase/pull or merging an op | ~1–3 min observed | run `./build_metal.sh` (Release/ninja) — the build target "ttnn" compiles+links into `build_Release/ttnn/_ttnn.so` but does NOT install; Python imports `ttnn/ttnn/_ttnn.so`, refreshed only by build_metal.sh's install step (or a manual copy). Symptom of skipping it: `AttributeError` on the new op |
| HF config-only download | first run / new variant | seconds-min, network | already cached by v3 conftest |
| Pre-commit hooks (isort/black, EOF fixer) | every commit | tens of sec | don't partial-stage — keep index clean or hooks loop on fix-rollback |

## Testing
- Primary goal: prefilled 50k cache, 5k chunk
- add determinism tests
- add accuracy tests that should match CPU reference (CPU reference outputs should be cached somewhere to speed-up testing)
