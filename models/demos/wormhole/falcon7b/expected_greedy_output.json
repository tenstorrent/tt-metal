", "Give a brief history of the internet (1985-present)\nThe internet began in 1969 as a project sponsored by the US Department of Defense to connect computers over long distances. The first internet protocol, called the 'Arpanet', was developed by computer scientist Robert Kahn in 1969. By 1973, the internet had expanded to a handful of universities and research institutions. In 1985, the National Science Foundation (NSF) launched the 'Internet Protocol Suite' (TCP/IP), which standardized the internet protocol and made it accessible to the wider public. This marked the beginning of the modern internet era. The 1990s saw the rise of the World Wide Web, which made it easier for users to access information and interact with each other online. The development of high-speed internet connections, such as DSL and cable, allowed users to connect to the internet at home. The 2000s saw the growth of social media, which transformed the way people communicate and share information online. Today, the internet is an integral part of daily life, connecting billions of users around the world.", "Describe to me some good coding practices \nSome good coding practices include: \n\n1.
