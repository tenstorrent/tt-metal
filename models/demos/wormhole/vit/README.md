# Vision Transformer (ViT) on WH - N150, N300.
This demo shows how ViT Base patch16-224 runs on WH - N150, N300 devices.

### Note:

- On N300, make sure to use `WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml` with the pytest.

- Or, make sure to set the following environment variable in the terminal:
  ```sh
  export WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml
  ```

- To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with following command:
  ```sh
  ./build_metal.sh -p
  ```

## Introduction

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model was proposed in "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words, Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale".
Itâ€™s the first paper that successfully trains a Transformer encoder on ImageNet, attaining very good results compared to familiar convolutional architectures.

### Details

- Entry point for the model is `vit` in `models/demos/vit/tt/ttnn_optimized_sharded_vit_wh.py`
- Batch Size: 8
- Sequence size: 224
- Dataset Used: `ImageNet-21k dataset`.

### Note:

- When running the ImageNet demo for the first time, you need to authenticate with Hugging Face by either running `huggingface-cli login` or setting the token directly using `export HF_TOKEN=<your_token>`.
- To obtain a huggingface token visit: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens.

## How to Run

- Use the following command to run the ViT model:

  ```sh
  pytest --disable-warnings tests/nightly/single_card/vit/test_ttnn_optimized_sharded_vit_wh.py::test_vit[224-3-224-8-google/vit-base-patch16-224]
  ```

### Demo

To run the demo for ViT model, follow these instructions:

-  For overall rutime inference (end-2-end), use the following command to run the demo:

    ```sh
    pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/wormhole/vit/demo/demo_vit_ttnn_inference_perf_e2e_2cq_trace.py
    ```

-  For inference device OPs analysis, use the following command to run the demo:

    ```sh
    # Need build to enable the profiler
    ./build_metal.sh -p

    # To manually inspect ops
    ./tt_metal/tools/profiler/profile_this.py -n vit -c "pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/wormhole/vit/demo/test_vit_device_perf.py::test_vit_device_ops"

    # For an automated device perf report(samples/s)
    pytest models/demos/wormhole/vit/demo/test_vit_device_perf.py::test_vit_perf_device
    ```

- Use the following command to run the demo and to test inference accuracy for Imagenet-21K:

  ```sh
  pytest --disable-warnings models/demos/wormhole/vit/demo/demo_vit_performant_imagenet_inference.py::test_run_vit_trace_2cqs_inference
  ```


## Results

- Model runtime (host end-2-end) is `~1370` FPS
- The Imagenet-21K inference accuracy is `80%`
