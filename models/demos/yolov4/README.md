## Platforms:
    Wormhole (n150, n300), Blackhole (p150)

## Introduction
YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model introduced in 2020 as an improved version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series. Designed for both speed and accuracy, YOLOv4 leverages advanced techniques such as weighted residual connections, cross-stage partial connections, and mosaic data
