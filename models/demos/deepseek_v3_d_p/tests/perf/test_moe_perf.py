"""
MoE device-perf tests approximating glx 8x4 from LB (8-chip) proxies.

- `test_deepseek_v3_moe_perf_loudbox`: runs 8x1 and 2x4 proxies once each, validates
  each against its own perf baseline, and in the same pass computes the approximate
  8x4 galaxy total (SP ops from 8x1 + TP ops from 2x4). One test, two device runs,
  three signals: per-proxy perf regression catches + approximation artifact.
- `test_deepseek_v3_moe_perf_galaxy`: 8x4 ground truth (skipped off-glx).

Sum of per-op approximation approximates one glx column's MoE block kernel time;
the 8x4 ground-truth test is the reference the approximation is compared against.
