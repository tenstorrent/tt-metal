    "The image contains a code snippet written in Python, which appears to be part of a machine learning or deep learning project. The code is too long to transcribe here, but it includes imports from various libraries such as `torch`, `vision`, and `model_args`. It also defines several functions and classes, including `skip_for_grayskull`, `test_llama_vision_encoder_inference`, and `reference_model`. The code seems to be related to image processing and computer vision tasks.\n\nHere is a brief summary of the code:\n\n*   The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some constants.\n*   It then defines a function `skip_for_grayskull` that takes a parameter `parametrize` and returns a value based on certain conditions.\n*   The next section of the code defines a test function `test_llama_vision_encoder_inference` that uses the `model_args` library to load a pre-trained model and perform inference on an input image.\n*   The code also defines a reference model `reference_model` that is used for comparison with the pre-trained model.\n*   Finally, the code defines a function `all_tests_pass` that checks if all tests have passed successfully.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a test script for evaluating the performance of a pre-trained model on a specific task, likely image classification or object detection.",
