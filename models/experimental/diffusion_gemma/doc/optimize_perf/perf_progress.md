# DiffusionGemma decode-throughput optimization — running progress

QB2 (`bh-qbge-06`, P150x4, mesh `(1,4)`, TP=4), branch `diffusion-gemma-function`, `build_Release`.
Optimization unit = **denoise step over the 256-token canvas** (≤48 steps/block) + **commit**.
Goal: raise decode throughput from ~1.3–2.3 t/s toward 30 t/s. One verified lever at a time.
All decode numbers are **traced** (eager is not acceptable evidence).

## Metric definitions (reported per lever)

- `ms_per_denoise_step` — warmed traced device time for one denoise step over the full 256 canvas, 30 layers.
- `steps_per_block` — denoise steps actually run before halt (≤ 48; data-dependent early-halt).
- `ms_per_block` = `steps_per_block × ms_per_denoise_step + commit_ms`.
- `tokens_per_block_per_s` = `256 / (ms_per_block / 1000)`.

## Baseline (established, prior work — see README.md / work_log.md / ttft_ts_sweep.md)

| quantity | value | source |
|---|---|---|
| TTFT (full 30L prefill) | 152–211 s | ttft_ts_sweep.md |
| ms_per_denoise_step (traced, 30L, projected from L=1/2/4) | **≈ 4176 ms** | README headline |
| — per-layer denoise | 137.55 ms/layer | README |
| — fixed overhead (embed+LMhead+terminal+norm) | 49.24 ms | README |
| commit (256 single-token decode-appends, 30L) | ≈ 31.5 s/block | README |
| ms_per_block @ 48 steps | ≈ 231.9 s | README |
| tokens_per_block_per_s @ 48 steps | **≈ 1.10** | README |
| roofline floor (weight traffic, 256 GB/s) | ≈ 24–49 ms/step | work_log §4 |

Per-step is context-independent (MoE weight-traffic bound); measured ~4176 ms is ~85–170× the
bandwidth roofline → **op-count / dense-MoE-compute bound**, large headroom.

## Target arithmetic

30 t/s ⇒ `ms_per_block ≈ 8533 ms`. At 48 steps that means ~170 ms/step incl. commit — a ~27×
reduction from 231.9 s/block. The denoise steps (200 s @48) dominate the block; commit is 31.5 s.

## Lever 1 — Traced-decode baseline / wire trace into measured path — **WASHOUT (recorded, not landed)**

**Question:** is the measured decode path traced? If eager, does wiring the trace-safe loop win?

**Findings (fresh, this session):**
- The measured decode path is **eager**. `serving.decode_block → denoise_and_commit_block →
  denoise_block` runs the eager loop with **5 host readbacks per step** (`argmax`, `entropy`,
  `sampled`, `accept_mask`, `canvas` → `to_torch`) plus a `torch.equal` stability halt check.
  Nothing wraps `run_fixed_denoise_steps` (the existing trace-safe device-only loop) in
  `begin_trace_capture`.
- **Quantified the readback overhead** apples-to-apples on the same reduced model
  (`bench_loop_readback.py`, L=2, 8 steps, canvas 256):

  | path | ms/step (L=2) |
  |---|---|
  | A: production eager `denoise_block` (host readback/step) | **359.27** |
  | B: trace-safe device-only loop, **traced** | **331.52** |
  | **readback overhead (A−B)** | **27.76 ms/step** |

- The 27.76 ms/step readback is a ~fixed per-step host cost (5 tiny 256-elem tensors + torch
  work), roughly layer-count independent. Against the 30-layer step (~4176 ms) it is **~0.66%**.
  This reconciles the README's "traced ≈ eager (~3%)" for the no-readback microbench.
- The whole-run tracy `GAP_FRACTION=81%` is a **device-profiler artifact**, not real host gap:
  clean wall-clock shows only 27.76 ms/step host overhead.

**Decision — do NOT wire a fixed-step trace into the measured path:**
1. The saving (~0.66% at 30L) is negligible vs the op-cost-bound step.
2. Tracing forces a **fixed 48-step** budget (early-halt cannot shorten a static trace). The eager
   path halts early when the canvas is stable+confident; converting to fixed-48 would **remove
   early-halt** and likely *regress* real blocks that converge in far fewer than 48 steps.

Lever 1 is therefore an honest washout for the denoise step. The genuine wins are the per-step
device compute (levers 2–4, dense-128-expert MoE) and the commit (256 sequential decode-appends).
Tracing may still help the **commit's** 256-decode inner loop and is revisited under lever 5.

_Artifacts:_ `bench_loop_readback.py`, `artifacts/lever1_readback_L2.log`,
`artifacts/lever1_traced_baseline_L2.log`.

## Lever 2 — Operation-topology audit — _in progress_

Need a clean per-op device-time breakdown of ONE traced denoise step (reduced layer) to locate the
true critical path (MoE `sparse_matmul` dense-128-expert vs `PermuteDeviceOperation` reorder vs
attention vs norms). Prior whole-run tracy is polluted by prefill+commit+profiler distortion.
