# Yolov6l

### Platforms:

Wormhole N150, N300

**Note:** On N300, make sure to use `WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml` with the pytest.

Or, make sure to set the following environment variable in the terminal:
```
export WH_ARCH_YAML=wormhole_b0_80_arch_eth_dispatch.yaml
```

To obtain the perf reports through profiler, please build with following command:
```
./build_metal.sh -p
```

### Introduction:
YOLOv6-L is a large variant of the YOLOv6 familyâ€”an advanced real-time object detection model developed by Meituan. YOLOv6 is designed to offer high performance in both accuracy and speed, making it suitable for industrial applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.
