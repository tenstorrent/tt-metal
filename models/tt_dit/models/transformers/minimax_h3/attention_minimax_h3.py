    The fused RoPE inside `dit_fused_distributed_rmsnorm` rotates by multiplying every 32-column tile
    by one 32x32 matrix, which pairs *adjacent* channels: `out[2i] = -in[2i+1]`, `out[2i+1] = in[2i]`.
    MiniMax-H3's reference instead pairs `i` with `i + rotary_dim/2`. The two are the same operation
    under this permutation of the rotary channels -- `out[2i] = in[i]`, `out[2i+1] = in[i + rot/2]` --
    with the `head_dim - rotary_dim` pass-through channels left where they are.

    Applied identically to the Q and K projection output channels, the QK-norm affine weight and the
    cos/sin tables. Attention sees Q and K only through `q . k`, which any *shared* permutation of the
    channel axis leaves unchanged, and V and `to_out` are untouched -- so the relayout is numerically
    neutral, not an approximation. Same trick as `transformer_ideogram4.rope_halfsplit_to_interleaved_perm`,

    Two things differ from `WanAttention` and drive the shape of this module:

    * The attention inner dim (`num_heads * head_dim` = 7168) is *larger* than the residual stream
      (`hidden_size` = 5376), so `to_q/k/v` widen 5376 -> 7168 and `to_out` narrows 7168 -> 5376.
      Nothing here may assume `inner_dim == hidden_size`. Every projection is bias-free.
    * The query/key norms are RMSNorms over `head_dim` (128), not over the TP-sharded residual
      stream. They use `DistributedRMSNorm` in `per_head_norm` mode, which reduces over each head's
      head_dim *locally* -- no all-gather, since a head's channels all live on one device -- and in
      the same op splits the heads and applies RoPE. So one fused op replaces the norm, the head
      split and the whole rotary sequence. See `rope_channel_permutation` for how MiniMax-H3's
      partial, half-split rotary is made to fit an op that implements a full-width interleaved one.

        Measured points come from the sweep in

        (model configs `minimax_h3_{5s,10s,15s}_768p`) on 4x8 Blackhole Galaxy, TP=4 / SP=8. Anything
        else falls back to the generic rule below.

        The optimum depends on the *local* sequence length, which is why this is keyed on it rather
        than on the mesh shape the way `WanAttention.sdpa_chunk_size_map` is. At long sequences there
        is enough work that (256, 512) wins -- a larger k halves the ring's K-loop iterations. At 5s
        there is too little work to fill 110 cores that way: 14 heads x ceil(4768/256) = 266 work items
        over 110 cores rounds up to 3 per core and wastes ~19% of the slots, whereas q=320 gives 210
        items, 2 per core and ~4.5% waste. That is worth more than the larger k.

        L1 (1.57 MB) bounds the (q, k) product, and the bound is what makes k=384 interesting: k=1024
        never fits, (320, 512) reaches 1.65 MB and does not either, but (320, 384) does -- combining
        the good q with a k larger than 256. Neither chunk size has to be a power of two, only a
        multiple of TILE, and restricting the search to {256, 512} misses this point entirely.

        Padding is not the thing to tune. 4768 is 32 x 149 with 149 prime, so no sensible chunk size
        divides it, yet at q=320 the Q padding is only 0.67%. Core slot efficiency dominates, and the
        optimum in it is sharp rather than a plateau: at 5s q=288 measured 10.43 ms against q=320's
        7.81 ms. Slot efficiency is a good candidate generator but not a predictor -- q=416 at 10s has
        the best slot efficiency of any k=256 point there (97.6%) and measured the worst (28.39 ms).
