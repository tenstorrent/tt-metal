"""Matmul block sizes for the MiniMax-H3 all-gather-matmul shapes.

Keyed on `(K, N, per_core_M)`, since the best block depends on the M-tiles per core, which varies with
video duration. Passed to the linear layers as `default_block_size`, which takes precedence in `get_agmm_config`.

Two hard constraints the op asserts on:

`N_block` must be divisible by `subblock_w`, which `get_matmul_config` leaves at 2 -- so N_block must
be even. (For a fused-SwiGLU ff1 it must be even anyway: gate/up tile pairs interleave along N and a
block must never split a pair.)

`K_block` must divide `K_tiles_per_device` (`K / 32 / tp_factor`). The ring delivers the gathered K
in `K_block`-sized chunks and a partial final chunk is unsupported. With TP=4 that means K_block
divides 42 for K=5376 and 56 for K=7168 -- 8 (the generic default) divides neither, which is why
these shapes need an entry rather than falling back.
