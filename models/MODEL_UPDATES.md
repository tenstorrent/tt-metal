- Achieved 45 t/s/u (and still working on further improvements) on Wormhole Galaxy for decode mode, with batch size 32 and 128 input sequence length. The included optimizations were: 1) using DRAM prefetching to remove memory bottlenecks for matmuls, 2) using [Sub-Devices](../tech_reports/SubDevices/SubDevices.md) to run multiple ops in parallel, 3) using CCLs enabled by [TT-Fabric](../tech_reports/TT-Fabric/TT-Fabric-Architecture.md).

- Added support for processing text-only prompts to the model and the [vLLM fork](https://github.com/tenstorrent/vllm/tree/dev/tt_metal).

## January 13, 2025

- Integrated Llama3 models (1B/3B/8B/11B/70B) into [vLLM fork](https://github.com/tenstorrent/vllm/tree/dev/tt_metal) for all compatible Tenstorrent devices (N150/N300/QuietBox/Galaxy).
- Enabled prefill with the maximum context length (131072) when running the Llama3 text models on smaller devices (N150/N300) via chunked prefill.

## December 16, 2024

### [Llama 3.1/3.2](tt_transformers)
- Added support for batch size 32 and the maximum context length (131072 tokens).
- Added full hardware compatibilty for the 1B/3B/8B/11B/70B models (all models are now compatible with N150, N300, QuietBox, Galaxy except for 70B which is only supported on QuietBox and Galaxy due to its large size).

## December 2, 2024

### [Llama 3.1/3.2](tt_transformers)
- Improved the decode performance of the 1B/3B/8B/11B text models (for 8B, increased from ~23 t/s/u to ~28 t/s/u) by using BFP4 weights (instead of BFP8) for FF1 and FF3 in the MLP.
