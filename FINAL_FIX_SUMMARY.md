# Final Fix Summary - Server Buffering Issue

## Problem
The allocation server was **working correctly** but its output was **buffered**, so:
- Periodic statistics (every 10 seconds) weren't displaying
- DUMP_REMAINING output wasn't showing
- Server appeared "hung" even though it was actively tracking allocations

## Root Cause
C++ `std::cout` is **line-buffered** by default when connected to a terminal, but **fully buffered** when:
- Running in background (`&`)
- Output redirected
- Running through certain terminal setups

This means output sits in a buffer and doesn't appear until:
- Buffer is full (typically 8KB)
- Program ends
- Explicit flush

## The Fix
Added **unbuffered output** at the start of `main()`:

```cpp
int main() {
    // Disable stdout buffering to ensure immediate output
    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
    setbuf(stderr, NULL);

    // ... rest of code
}
```

This ensures **all output appears immediately** without waiting for buffer to fill.

## How to Apply

1. **Rebuild the server:**
```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv/tt_metal/programming_examples/alexp_examples/memory_utilization_monitor
./build_allocation_server.sh
```

2. **Kill old server:**
```bash
pkill allocation_ser
```

3. **Start new server:**
```bash
./allocation_server_poc
```

4. **Run your test:**
```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
pytest models/tt_transformers/demo/simple_text_demo.py -k "performance and batch-1"
```

## What You'll Now See

### During Test Execution:
```
✓ [PID 12345] Allocated 524288 bytes of L1 on device 0...
✗ [PID 12345] Freed buffer 123456 on device 0...
⚠ [PID 12345] Deallocation for unknown buffer...
```

### Every 10 Seconds:
```
📊 Current Statistics:
  Device 0:
    Buffers: 150
    DRAM: 5242880 bytes (5120.0 KB)
    L1: 3145728 bytes (3072.0 KB)
    Total: 8388608 bytes
  Active allocations: 150
```

### After Test (from cleanup fixture):
```
📋 Received DUMP_REMAINING request...

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           REMAINING ALLOCATED BUFFERS                       ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
Total tracked allocations: 42

Device 0:
  L1: 5 buffers, 0.5 MB total
    - Buffer 0x123456: 100.0 KB (PID 12345, ref_count=2)
    ...

📋 DUMP_REMAINING complete.
```

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **conftest.py** - Cleanup fixture now prints to stderr (visible in pytest)
2. ✅ **simple_text_demo.py** - Explicit cache clearing at end of test
3. ✅ **allocation_server_poc.cpp** - Unbuffered output for immediate visibility
4. ✅ **allocation_server_poc.cpp** - Re-enabled "unknown buffer" warnings
5. ✅ **allocation_server_poc.cpp** - Proper handling of DUMP_REMAINING (no premature close)
6. ✅ **allocation_server_poc.cpp** - Added KB formatting to stats output

Everything should now work perfectly!
