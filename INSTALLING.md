#### Install System-level Dependencies
For Ubuntu users. You can use the script provided in our repo to install build and runtime dependencies along with a working copy of Clang 17.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/refs/heads/main/{install_dependencies.sh,tt_metal/sfpi-version.sh}
chmod a+x install_dependencies.sh
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
```

For users on other Linux distributions, please consult the `install_dependencies.sh` script to see what packages need to be installed, then install the equivalent packages using your distribution's package manager. Package names may vary between distributions, and some distributions (like Gentoo and Arch) may not use suffixes like `-dev` or `-devel` for development packages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Building with Clang 17 and GCC 12 is supported. Later versions, while not officially supported, should work. For Ubuntu 22.04 users, the default compiler is GCC 11 and Clang 14. Please install a newer compiler to ensure a successful build (the dependency installaion script will install Clang 17 for you).

#### Install System Management Interface (TT-SMI)
- Install Tenstorrent Software Management Interface (TT-SMI) according to the table above. We will use a specific version here as an example:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi@v3.0.12
```

- Verify System Configuration

Once hardware and system software are installed, verify that the system has been configured correctly.

  - Run the TT-SMI utility:
  ```
  tt-smi
  ```
  A display with device information, telemetry, and firmware will appear:<br>

![image](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/_images/tt_smi.png)
<br>
  If the tool runs without error, your system has been configured correctly.

- For more information, visit Tenstorrent's [TT-SMI GitHub repository](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-smi).

---

#### (Optional) Multi-Card Configuration (TT-Topology)

> [!CAUTION]
> Be sure to align the topology version with the compatible version in the table above for your particular configuration.

### TT-NN / TT-Metalium Installation

#### There are four options for installing TT-Metalium:

- [Option 1: From Binaries](#binaries)

  Install pre-built binaries for quick setup and immediate access to TT-NN APIs and AI models.

- [Option 2: From Docker Release Image](#docker-release-image)

  Installing from Docker Release Image is a quick way to access our APIs and start running AI models.

- [Option 3: From Source](#source)

  Installing from source gets developers closer to the metal and the source code.

- [Option 4: From Anaconda](#anaconda)

  Installing from Anaconda can be convienient for ML Developers who prefer that workflow.

---

### Binaries
Install from wheel for quick access to `ttnn` Python APIs and to get an AI model running.
All binaries support only Linux and distros with glibc 2.34 or newer.

#### Step 1. Install the Latest Wheel:

- Install the wheel using `pip`:

  ```sh
  pip install ttnn
  ```

#### Step 2. (For models users only) Set Up Environment for Models:

To try our pre-built models in `models/`, you must:

  - Install their required dependencies
  - Set appropriate environment variables
  - Set the CPU performance governor to ensure high performance on the host

- This is done by executing the following:
  ```sh
  export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
  pip install -r tt_metal/python_env/requirements-dev.txt
  sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils
  sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
  ```

---

### Docker Release Image

Download the latest Docker release from our [Docker registry](https://github.com/orgs/tenstorrent/packages?q=tt-metalium-ubuntu&tab=packages&q=tt-metalium-ubuntu-22.04-release-amd64) page

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/tenstorrent/tt-metal/tt-metalium-ubuntu-22.04-release-amd64:latest-rc
docker run -it --rm -v /dev/hugepages-1G:/dev/hugepages-1G --device /dev/tenstorrent ghcr.io/tenstorrent/tt-metal/tt-metalium-ubuntu-22.04-release-amd64:latest-rc bash
```

- For more information on the Docker Release Images, visit our [Docker registry page](https://github.com/orgs/tenstorrent/packages?q=tt-metalium-ubuntu&tab=packages&q=tt-metalium-ubuntu-22.04-release-amd64).

- You are all set! Try some [TT-NN Basic Examples](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/usage.html#basic-examples) next.

---

### Source
Install from source if you are a developer who wants to be close to the metal and the source code. Recommended for running the demo models.

#### Step 1. Clone the Repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal.git --recurse-submodules
```

#### Step 2. Build the Library:

You have two options for building the library:

**Option A: Using the Build Script (Recommended)**

The build script provides the simplest way to build the library and works well with the standard build tools installed via `install_dependencies.sh`.

```
./build_metal.sh
```

**Option B: Manual Build with CMake**

For users who prefer more control over build options or have custom setups, you can build manually:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<your compiler>
ninja
ninja install # Installs to build directory by default, required for Python environment
```

#### Step 3. Crate a virtual environment and (optional) documentation.

- (recommended) For an out-of-the-box virtual environment to use, execute:
```
./create_venv.sh
source python_env/bin/activate
```

- (optional) Software dependencies for profiling use:
  - Download and install [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html), (v1.9 or higher, but less than v1.10)

- Continue to [You Are All Set!](#you-are-all-set)

---

### Anaconda
Anaconda is another virtual environment manager. There is a community driven recipe [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/tt-metalium-feedstock). There is support for Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
All binaries support only Linux and distros with glibc 2.34 or newer.

#### Step 1. Install the Latest Package:

- Install the package using `conda`:

  ```sh
  conda create -n metalium python=3.10 tt-metalium -c conda-forge
  ```

---

### You are All Set!

#### To verify your installation (for source or wheel installation only), try executing a programming example:

- First, set the following environment variables:

  ```
  export TT_METAL_HOME=</path/to/your/tt-metal>
  export PYTHONPATH="${TT_METAL_HOME}" # Same path
  ```

- Then, try running a programming example:
  ```
  python3 -m ttnn.examples.usage.run_op_on_device
  ```

- For more programming examples to try, visit Tenstorrent's [TT-NN Basic Examples Page](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/usage.html#basic-examples) or get started with [Simple Kernels on TT-Metalium](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/tt-metalium/tt_metal/examples/index.html)
