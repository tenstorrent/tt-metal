# This pipeline is the minimum bar a PR must pass before it can pass the merge queue.
# It is intended to be relatively fast and lightweight that the delay between completing
# a PR and having the changes available on main is not onerous.

# Requirements for all jobs in this workflow:
# - End-to-end (excluding wait times for runners) must be less than 15mins.
#   This includes the cost of checking out the code, preparing a runner, etc.
# - Individual test cases must be less than 5s.
