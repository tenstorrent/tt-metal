# Some explanation:
# is-release-candidate is always true, unless the workflow is manually dispatched on a tag
# should-create-release is used to avoid creating a duplicate release
# if we are running on main branch, don't upload any artifacts or create a gh release
# if we are promoting a release candidate, don't rerun the tests
