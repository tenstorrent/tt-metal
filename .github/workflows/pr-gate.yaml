name: PR Gate
# This pipeline is the minimum bar a PR must pass before it can be merged.
# It is intended to be fast and lightweight to trigger automatically on every
# change in every PR and provide quick feedback without overloading the CI.

# Requirements for all jobs in this workflow:
# - A new job must cancel a previously scheduled/running job.
#   PRs only care about the latest commit and multiple pushes may happen in quick succession.
# - End-to-end (excluding wait times for runners) must be less than 5mins.
#   This includes the cost of checking out the code, preparing a runner, etc.
# - Individual test cases must be less than 1s.
