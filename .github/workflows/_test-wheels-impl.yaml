# THIS COMMENT NEEDS REEVALUATION AND THE WORKFLOW NEEDS CLEANUP
# Since pre-compiled assets are only built on ubuntu-20.04, we force tests
# to only be run on ubuntu-20.04.
#
# Otherwise, we run across 20.04 and 22.04 as we should have assets for both
# from previous wheel builds if from-precompiled is false.
#
# I chose the more heavy-handed approach because:
# - This should all go away soon once we have more OSes + more Docker up and
# running so we can matrix properly across more stuff
# - though provides less flexibility to caller workflows, we want to be pretty
# strict with the matrix + doesn't change often
