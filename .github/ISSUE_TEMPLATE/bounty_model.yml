        Faster-RCNN example:
        This bounty is for bringing up the [Faster-RCNN](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/models/faster_rcnn.html) model using TTNN APIs on Tenstorrent hardware (Wormhole or Blackhole). Faster-RCNN is a widely used deep learning model for object detection in images, applied in autonomous vehicles, surveillance, robotics, and various vision-based industrial applications. The objective is to enable the model to run efficiently on TT hardware, allowing Tenstorrent users and partners to leverage high-throughput, low-latency inference for object detection tasks.

      placeholder: |
        Define a list or checklist of clear, testable acceptance criteria - this is the goal the developer is chasing. They achieve all stages, we pay. Model bounties are split into 3 stages.
        e.g. A successful submission will fulfill all requirements in the following stages. Payout is made after all stages are completed.

      label: "Stage 1 ‚Äî Bring-Up"
      description: "List things that they need to achieve for us to consider the model working"
      placeholder: |
        - Produce correct classification given input images
        - Generates coherent text or correct object detections
        - Which to validate against? What's the expected accuracy?
        - Output should be easily verifiable, we can see the model is working
    validations:
      required: true

      description: "A list of techniques that are easy to implement. Make sure they are applicable to the model."
      placeholder: |
        - Store temporary results in L1
        - Fused activation after matmul
        - Change image tensors to sharding
        - You name it, these should be relatively easy changes

      required: true

      label: "Stage 3 ‚Äî Deeper Optimization"
      description: "More involved optimizations are listed here. Adapt the model to exploit TT hardware features and reduce unnecessary TM/memory overheads. We are not asking the user to understand all possible optimization processes. But enough to touch on the differences of our hardware and GPUs."
      placeholder: |
        - Grouped Convolutions
        - Use of SDPA operator
        - avoiding TMs by changing order of operation

        ## üìä Result Submission Guidelines

        Beyond the model implementation itself, contributors must submit the following material as proof of work.
        However, feel free to open a PR at any time if you want us checking that you are on the right track.
        Just understand that payout is only made after **all 3 stages** are completed.

        **Deliverables:**
        - Functional model implementation
        - Validation logs (output correctness)
        - Performance report + header for final review

        **Links:**
        - [Performance Sheet](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/tech_reports/ttnn/TTNN-model-bringup.md#41-performance-sheet)
        - [Perf Header Docs](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/profiling_ttnn_operations.html#perf-report-headers)
