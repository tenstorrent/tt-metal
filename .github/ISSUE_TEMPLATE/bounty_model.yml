# [Bounty $amount] [Issue Title]




## 📝 Background




Context about what the bounty is about - What model to bring up. Where the model is used in the real world. What does the model do? Who would be interested in the models?




## 🎯 What Success Looks Like




Define a list or checklist of clear, testable acceptance criteria - this is the goal the developer is chasing. They achieve all stages, we pay. Model bounties are split into 3 stages


### Stage 1 - bring up


List things that they need to achieve for us to consider the model working


ex:
- Produce correct classification given input images
- Generates coherent text or correct object detections
- Which to validate against? What's the expected accuracy?
- Output should be easily verifiable, we can see the model is working


### Stage 2 - basic optimizations


A list of techniques that are easy to implement. Make sure they are applicable to the model


- Store temporary results in L1
- Fused activation after matmul
- Change image tensors to sharding
- You name it, these should be relatively easy changes




### Stage 3 - Deeper Optimization




More involved optimizations are listed here. Adapt the model to exploit TT hardware features and reduce unnecessary TM/memory overheads. We are not asking the user to understand all possible optimization processes. But enough to touch on the differences of our hardware and GPUs.




ex:
- Grouped Convolutions
- Use of SDPA operator
- avoiding TMs by changing order of operation




## 🧭 Guidance & Starting Points
Provide guidance, links to files, or code snippets and links. Help the user to get started with the bounty




ex:
- Links to code, docs, previous work or tech report
- Advice on what to look out for, or who to ask for help
- Link to original model paper




## 🔎 Possible Approaches
- List one or more technical paths, architectural suggestions, or research ideas
- Help the developer not succumb to analysis paralysis/"too many options, don't know what to do"




## 📊 Result submission guidelines notes




Mention to the user that they are welcomed to open a PR at any stage if they want us to check if their approach is on the right path. But payout is only made after all 3 stages are completed.




* Functional model implementation
* Validation logs (output correctness)
* Performance report + header for final review

Something along the lines of:


> Beyond the model implementation itself. Contributors must submit the following material as a proof of work. However, feel free to open a PR at any time if you want us checking you are on the right track. Just understand that payout is only made after all 3 stages are completed.
