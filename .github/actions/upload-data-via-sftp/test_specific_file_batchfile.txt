# Test batchfile for uploading oprun files from /work/tests/sweep_framework/results_export/
# This will upload all files starting with "oprun_" (typically oprun_*.json files)

# Change to the results_export directory
cd tests/sweep_framework/results_export

# Create a test directory on the server (optional)
mkdir test_uploads

# Upload all oprun files to the test directory
put oprun_* test_uploads/

# List files to verify upload
ls -hal test_uploads/

# Show what files we're uploading from local directory
ls -hal oprun_*
