# This file defines the maximum allowed timeout (in minutes) for tests
# belonging to a given team and workflow.
# These budgets are enforced during the load-test-matrix step in pipelines.

# This is part of an effort to reorganize the pipelines for clearer resource allocation and ownership.

# Entries are grouped by team -> pipeline -> sku (machine type in CI) : time_budget (in minutes)

# Team names are currently assigned to tests by best guess.
#   Please message #tt-metal-infra if there are any concerns.
# Sku names do not make the distinction between baremetal/vm, or viommu/non-viommu.
#   This will be determined per pipeline based on need.
