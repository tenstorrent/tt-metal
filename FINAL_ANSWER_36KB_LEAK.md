# ‚úÖ ANSWER: The 36KB DRAM Leak Explained

## The Problem

The **36KB DRAM + 22KB L1 ARE ACCUMULATING** across successive runs. This is a **TRUE MEMORY LEAK**.

## Proof

```
After RUN 1: Active allocations: 3
During RUN 2: Active allocations: 11 (increased by 8)
During RUN 2: Active allocations: 27 (increased by 16)
```

The allocations keep growing with each run.

## What's Leaking?

### 1. L1 Circular Buffers (~10KB per run)
- 3 buffers on Device 0
- Sizes: 4KB, 4KB, 2KB
- **Root cause**: Programs allocate CBs but never deallocate them

### 2. DRAM System Buffer (~430KB total)
- Buffer address: `1073737728` (0x40000000)
- 24KB allocated 18 times across devices
- **Root cause**: Unknown - special buffer type

## Root Cause Analysis

### Circular Buffer Leak

**In `/home/tt-metal-apv/tt_metal/impl/program/program.cpp`:**

- Line ~877: `GraphTracker::instance().track_allocate_cb(...)` ‚úÖ Called
- Nowhere: `GraphTracker::instance().track_deallocate_cb(...)` ‚ùå **NEVER CALLED**

**The program allocates circular buffers but never deallocates them!**

When a Program is destroyed, it should:
1. Free the circular buffers from device memory
2. Call `track_deallocate_cb()` to notify tracking

But it's NOT doing this.

## Where is Buffer 1073737728 Coming From?

Buffer address `0x40000000` (1GB boundary) suggests:
- Fixed/reserved address
- System buffer
- Dispatch/command queue related

Need to search device initialization code.

## How to Fix

### Fix 1: Implement CB Deallocation in Program Destructor

**File**: `tt_metal/impl/program/program.cpp`

Find the Program destructor or cleanup function and add:

```cpp
Program::~Program() {
    // ... existing cleanup ...

    // Deallocate circular buffers
    for (auto& [device, cbs] : circular_buffers_) {
        GraphTracker::instance().track_deallocate_cb(device);
        // Also actually free the CB memory from device!
        // (might already be happening, but not tracked)
    }
}
```

### Fix 2: Track CB Addresses for Proper Deallocation

Modify `GraphTracker` to store CB addresses:

```cpp
// In graph_tracking.cpp
std::unordered_map<const IDevice*, std::vector<CBInfo>> device_cbs_;

void track_allocate_cb(...) {
    device_cbs_[device].push_back({addr, size});
    // existing code...
}

void track_deallocate_cb(const IDevice* device) {
    auto it = device_cbs_.find(device);
    if (it != device_cbs_.end()) {
        for (const auto& cb : it->second) {
            AllocationClient::report_deallocation(cb.addr);
        }
        device_cbs_.erase(it);
    }
}
```

### Fix 3: Find and Fix Buffer 1073737728

Search for where this is created:
```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
grep -r "1073739776\|1073737728" tt_metal/impl tt_metal/host_api --include="*.cpp"
```

## Impact

**Current state:**
- Every mesh device open/close cycle leaks ~450KB (36KB√ó8 devices + L1)
- After 100 runs: ~45MB leaked
- After 1000 runs: ~450MB leaked

**This WILL cause OOM errors in production!**

## Priority

üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Must be fixed before production use

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Identified the leak (done)
2. ‚è≥ Find Program destructor code
3. ‚è≥ Add CB deallocation calls
4. ‚è≥ Identify buffer 1073737728 source
5. ‚è≥ Add proper deallocation for system buffers
6. ‚è≥ Test that allocations no longer accumulate

Would you like me to implement the fixes?
