/**
 * Performs the necessary hardware and software initialization for reduce operation for provided circular buffer identifiers (CB IDs). In order for reduce
 * operation to be performed, this function call must be followed by a call to `reduce_tile` or `reduce_tile_math`.
 * If another reduce op is needed which uses different CB IDs, then another reduce_init needs to be called as a part of that reduce operation.
 *
 * The `icb_scaler` circular buffer must contain the scaling factors for the reduction. The most straightforward way of filling the `icb_scaler` with the scaling
 * factors is to populate first row of each face with the followin values:
 * - If `reduce_type = SUM`, all scaling factors should preferably be 1.
 * - If `reduce_type = AVG`, all scaling factors should preferably be 1/N (where N is the number of elements being averaged, except if the reduction dimension is scalar,
 * in which case the scaling factor should be 1/sqrt(N)).
 * - If `reduce_type = MAX`, all scaling factors should preferably be 1.
 *
 * NOTE: For SUM and AVG operations, the value in `icb_scaler` is a scaling factor of the final sum of values across rows/columns/both, so there is no real constraint in terms
 * of it's value. For MAX operation, maximum value will be obtained as expected, but it will be scaled by the values in `icb_scaler`. In any case, it is recommended to use the
 * above-mentioned scaling factors to ensure that operations function as intended. Refer to ISA documentation for more details.
 * NOTE: For other valid ways of populating the `icb_scaler`, refer to the ISA documentation.
 *
 * Return value: None
