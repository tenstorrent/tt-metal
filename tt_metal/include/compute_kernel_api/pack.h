 * Copies a single tile from the DST register buffer at a specified index to a
 * specified CB at a given index. For the out_tile_index to be valid for this
 * call, cb_reserve_back(n) has to be called first to reserve at least some
 * number n > 0 of tiles in the output CB. out_tile_index = 0 then references
 * the first tile in the reserved section of the CB, up to index n - 1, which will
 * then be visible to the consumer in the same order after a cb_push_back call.
 * The DST register buffer must be in acquired state via *acquire_dst* call.
 * This call is blocking and is only available on the compute engine.
 *
 * Each subsequent pack call will increment the write pointer in the cb by single
 * tile size. The pointer is then again set to a valid position with space for n
 * reserved tiles by another cb_reserve_back call.
 *
 * Operates in tandem with functions cb_reserve_back and cb_push_back.
 *
 * A typical use case is first the producer ensures that there is a number of
 * tiles available in the buffer via cb_reserve_back, then the producer uses
 * the pack_tile call to copy a tile from one of DST slots to a slot in
 * reserved space and finally cb_push_back is called to announce visibility of
 * the reserved section of the circular buffer to the consumer.
