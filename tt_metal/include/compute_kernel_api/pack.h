/**
 * Copies a single tile from the DEST register buffer at a specified index to a
 * specified CB at a given index. For the out_tile_index to be valid for this
 * call, cb_reserve_back(n) has to be called first to reserve at least some
 * number n > 0 of tiles in the output CB. out_tile_index = 0 then references
 * the first tile in the reserved section of the CB, up to index n - 1, which will
 * then be visible to the consumer in the same order after a cb_push_back call.
 * The DEST register buffer must be in acquired state via *acquire_dst* call.
 * This call is blocking and is only available on the compute engine.
 *
 * Each subsequent pack call will increment the write pointer in the cb by single
 * tile size. The pointer is then again set to a valid position with space for n
 * reserved tiles by another cb_reserve_back call.
 *
 * Operates in tandem with functions cb_reserve_back and cb_push_back.
 *
 * A typical use case is first the producer ensures that there is a number of
 * tiles available in the buffer via cb_reserve_back, then the producer uses
 * the pack_tile call to copy a tile from one of DEST slots to a slot in
 * reserved space and finally cb_push_back is called to announce visibility of
 * the reserved section of the circular buffer to the consumer.
 *
 * When the `out_of_order_output` flag is set to true, `pack_tile` behaves like
 * other APIs in that it writes the output tile to the tile index specified by
 * the user in `output_tile_index` within the reserved region of the circular
 * buffer, but relative to the position that might have been previously updated
 * by `cb_push_back` function. If `out_of_order_output` is false (the default),
 * `pack_tile` always operates sequentially: it writes to the next tile index
 * starting from index 0, and the `output_tile_index` parameter is ignored. In
 * this mode, each call to `pack_tile` advances the internal write pointer for
 * the reserved region, which is reset after `cb_push_back` function.
 *
 * NOTE: pack_tile doesn't need explicit initialization function prior to its call. Other op-specific
 * initialization functions (such as `tilize_init`, `reduce_init`, etc.) ensure proper initialization
 * of the packer. The reason for this stems from the fact that MATH and PACK threads need to be explicitly
 * synchronized in the kernels. To ensure this synchronization, tile packing is implemented as a separate
 * API call.
 *
 * Return value: None
