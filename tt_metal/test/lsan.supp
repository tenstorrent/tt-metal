# ASan Build with LeakSantizer complains about leaks in openmpi lib.
leak:openmpi

# The RISC-V cross-compiler toolchain (sfpi) is invoked at runtime to build
# firmware. When LD_PRELOAD injects ASan into these subprocesses, LeakSanitizer
# reports benign "leaks" from the compiler itself (compilers often skip freeing
# memory at exit since the OS reclaims it). Suppress these false positives.
