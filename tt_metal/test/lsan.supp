# Manifests in OpenMPI v4.1.2 and remains an issue on v5.0.3
# Bug: https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/12584
# ASan Build with LeakSantizer complains about leaks in openmpi lib.
leak:openmpi

# PMIX library (part of MPI stack) has known leaks at shutdown
leak:libpmix

# Python interpreter doesn't free all memory at process exit.
# This is intentional for performance (no point cleaning up when OS reclaims everything).
# These show up as "leaks" but are not actual memory leaks in the traditional sense.
leak:python3

# PyTorch (libtorch_python.so) has similar intentional non-cleanup at exit.
# These are well-known false positives when running PyTorch under LeakSanitizer.
leak:libtorch_python
