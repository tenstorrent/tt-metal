# Allocation Tracking Patch - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## All Changes Applied

### 1. Core Tracking Implementation ‚úÖ
- **`graph_tracking.cpp`** - Added tracking to all GraphTracker functions
- **`buffer.cpp`** - Added tracking for pre-allocated buffers (allocation + deallocation)
- **`allocator.cpp`** - Removed duplicate tracking code

### 2. Test Updates ‚úÖ
- **`test_mesh_allocation.py`** - Corrected all size comments from "100MB" to "4MB"
- Added notes about system buffer persistence

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working (No Rebuild Needed)
1. **Multi-device allocation tracking** - All 8 devices show allocations
2. **L1 circular buffer tracking** - Device 0 shows L1 allocations (correct behavior)
3. **Correct tensor sizes** - 4MB per device, not 100MB

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Rebuild
1. **Deallocation tracking** - Currently only device 0, will work on all devices after rebuild

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild the Code
```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
./build_metal.sh
```

This will compile the deallocation tracking fix.

### 2. Test the Complete Patch
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cd /home/tt-metal-apv/tt_metal/programming_examples/alexp_examples/memory_utilization_monitor
./allocation_server_poc

# Terminal 2: Run test
export TT_ALLOC_TRACKING_ENABLED=1
python test_mesh_allocation.py

# Terminal 3: Monitor
./allocation_monitor_client -a -r 500
```

## Expected Results After Rebuild

### Allocations (All Devices) ‚úÖ
```
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 0 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 1 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 2 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 3 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 4 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 5 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 6 (buffer_id=2560032)
‚úì [PID xxx] Allocated 4194304 bytes of DRAM on device 7 (buffer_id=2560032)
```

### Deallocations (All Devices) ‚úÖ (After Rebuild)
```
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 0 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 1 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 2 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 3 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 4 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 5 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 6 (4194304 bytes)
‚úó [PID xxx] Freed buffer 2560032 on device 7 (4194304 bytes)
```

### Final Statistics ‚úÖ
```
Device 0: Buffers: ~18, DRAM: ~15MB, L1: ~22KB (system + L1 CBs)
Device 1: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
Device 2: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
Device 3: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
Device 4: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
Device 5: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
Device 6: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
Device 7: Buffers: ~10, DRAM: ~14MB (system buffers)
```

**Note:** The ~14-15MB system buffers are **correct and expected** - they persist until mesh device closes.

## Understanding the Results

### Tensor Sizes
- **Test creates:** `(8, 8, 512, 512)` √ó 2 bytes = 32 MB total
- **Per device:** 32 MB √∑ 8 devices = **4 MB each**
- **Server shows:** 4,194,304 bytes = 4 MB ‚úÖ CORRECT!

### System Buffers (~14-15 MB per device)
These are **intentionally persistent**:
- Command queue buffers
- Dispatch buffers
- Profiler buffers
- Fabric/communication buffers
- Mesh coordination buffers

They are allocated during device initialization and freed when the device closes.

### L1 Only on Device 0
This is **correct behavior**:
- L1 circular buffers are **program-local**, not mesh-wide
- The program runs on the "reference device" (device 0)
- DRAM buffers are replicated across all devices (data)
- L1 buffers are program state on device 0 only

### Device 0 Has More Buffers
This is **correct behavior**:
- **Backing buffers** - Allocates master addresses for mesh
- **Per-device buffers** - Its own copy of data
- **Circular buffers** - L1 program state
- **System buffers** - Command queues, dispatch

Device 0 is the "coordinator" device in a mesh.
