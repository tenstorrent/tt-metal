# SOLUTION: Wrong Build Directory!

## The Problem

You were building in `/home/tt-metal-apv/build/` but the actual libraries and executables use `/home/tt-metal-apv/build_Release_tracy/`!

When you ran:
```bash
cmake --build build --target impl -j8
```

It built in the wrong directory. The test program links against:
```
/home/tt-metal-apv/build_Release_tracy/tt_metal/libtt_metal.so
```

## The Solution

**Always build in `build_Release_tracy`:**

```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
cmake --build build_Release_tracy --target impl -j8
```

## What Just Happened

1. ✅ Rebuilt `allocator.cpp`, `device.cpp`, `sub_device_manager.cpp` in the CORRECT directory
2. ✅ The `libtt_metal.so` now has your device ID fixes
3. ✅ The C++ test should now work correctly

## Test Now

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server
cd /home/tt-metal-apv/tt_metal/programming_examples/alexp_examples/memory_utilization_monitor
./allocation_server_poc

# Terminal 2: C++ Test
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
export TT_ALLOC_TRACKING_ENABLED=1
./build/programming_examples/test_tracking_cpp
```

You should now see allocations in Terminal 1!

## For Python

To make Python work, you need to rebuild the Python bindings in the correct directory:

```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
./build_metal.sh
```

This will:
1. Build everything in `build_Release_tracy`
2. Build the Python bindings
3. Link them to the correct library

## Summary

The issue wasn't with your code - it was that you were building in the wrong directory! Your changes are correct, they just weren't being compiled into the library that was actually being used.
