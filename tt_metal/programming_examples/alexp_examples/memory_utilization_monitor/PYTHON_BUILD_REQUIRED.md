# Python Bindings Not Built

## Current Status

✅ **C++ tracking works** - `test_tracking_cpp` successfully shows allocations
❌ **Python doesn't work** - Python bindings (`_ttnncpp.so`) were not built

## What Happened

You rebuilt the `impl` target (C++ library), but the Python bindings were not compiled. The Python `ttnn` module needs its own compilation step.

## Solution: Build Python Bindings

### Option 1: Full Build (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
./build_metal.sh
```

This will build everything including Python bindings. It takes 10-15 minutes.

### Option 2: Build Only Python Bindings (Faster)
```bash
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
cmake --build build --target _ttnn -j8
```

This only builds the Python extension, should be faster.

## Verification

After building, verify the Python extension exists:
```bash
ls -lh /home/tt-metal-apv/build/lib/_ttnncpp.so
```

Should show a file like:
```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 45M Oct 7 00:50 /home/tt-metal-apv/build/lib/_ttnncpp.so
```

## Then Test

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server
cd /home/tt-metal-apv/tt_metal/programming_examples/alexp_examples/memory_utilization_monitor
./allocation_server_poc

# Terminal 2: Python test
cd /home/tt-metal-apv
source python_env/bin/activate
export TT_ALLOC_TRACKING_ENABLED=1
python tt_metal/programming_examples/alexp_examples/memory_utilization_monitor/test_ttnn_allocations.py
```

## Why C++ Works But Python Doesn't

| Component | File | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| C++ Library | `libtt_metal.so` | ✅ Built (you did this) |
| C++ Test | `test_tracking_cpp` | ✅ Works (links to libtt_metal.so) |
| Python Bindings | `_ttnncpp.so` | ❌ **NOT BUILT** |
| Python Scripts | `test_ttnn_allocations.py` | ❌ Can't import ttnn |

## Current Error

When you try to import ttnn:
```
ImportError: _ttnncpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

This means the Python extension was never compiled.

## What to Do Now

1. **Run the full build**: `cd /home/tt-metal-apv && ./build_metal.sh`
2. **Wait for it to complete** (10-15 minutes)
3. **Verify the .so file exists**: `ls -lh build/lib/_ttnncpp.so`
4. **Test Python**: Run `test_ttnn_allocations.py` with tracking enabled

## Alternative: Continue with C++

If you don't want to wait for the Python build, you can continue testing with C++ programs. The allocation tracking **is working** - it's just that Python can't use it yet because the bindings aren't compiled.

All C++ programs that link to `libtt_metal.so` will have working allocation tracking.
