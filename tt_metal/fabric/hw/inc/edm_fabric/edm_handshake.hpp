 * Before any payload messages can be exchanged over the link, we must ensure that the other end
 * of the link is ready to start sending/receiving messages. We perform a handshake to ensure that's
 * case. Before handshaking, we make sure to clear any of the channel sync datastructures local
 * to our core.
 *
 * The handshaking process is split into two parts for the sender/master and two parts for the
 * the subordinate. The handshake is broken into 2 parts so that the master can initiate the handshake
 * as early as possible so the message can be "in flight" over the ethernet link while other EDM
 * initialization is taking place.
 *
 * Important note about handshaking: the sender/master canNOT complete the handshake until all receiver
 * channels are initialized. Otherwise we have a race between channel initialization on the receiver side
 * and real payload data (and signals) using those channels.
 *
 * Note that the master and subordinate concepts here only apply in the context of handshaking and initialization
 * of the EDM. They do not apply during the main EDM execution loop.
 *
 * The basic protocol for the handshake is to use the reserved space at erisc_info[0] where the master writes
 * and sends payload available information to that channel. The receive must acknowledge that message and upon
 * doing so, considers the handshake complete.
