# tt mem_bench

Utility to measure host and device bandwidth on Tenstorrent devices.

## Build

Tools are included in `tt_metal` builds. Using a release build is required for accurate perf measurements.

## Usage

By default, each test is run for 5 iterations and only basic tests are executed. All test patterns can be executed by specifying `--full`. Additional run parameters are listed below.

Tests will report host bandwidth and/or device bandwidth. If device bandwidth is reported, then the average of all cores is reported as well as bandwidth for just a single core.

> [!NOTE]
The `tt_metal` library log level can be adjusted by exporting `TT_LOGGER_LEVEL=fatal|info|error|debug`.

> [!NOTE]
On NUMA systems, the host page for the device's command queue data is pinned on the memory node closest to where the device is located. If `tt_metal` is run on a different node then bandwidth will degrade because it'll need to cross sockets. Therefore, it's important to run `tt_metal` on the closest node. On Linux, the execution policy can be set using `numactl`. E.g., if the device is located on node 0, then `numactl --cpubind=0 --membind=0 <command>` will allocate resources closer to the device.
