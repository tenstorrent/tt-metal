/**
 * Host object for a durable cross-program remote DFB.
 *
 * Lifetime: construction allocates the data ring + config page from persistent L1
 * pages once, and this handle owns them. Keep it alive for the entire time any program
 * Attaches / uses it; destroying it frees the ring and config, and an attached Program
 * holds a non-owning reference that does not keep either alive. The runtime does not
 * fence peers; only destroy (or let it go out of scope) after every peer program has
 * Finished.
 *
 * Splitting the implementation out does not change any of that. The pipe object itself is
 * immovable and CreatePrefetcherPipe hands back a unique_ptr, so callers store and pass
 * around the owning pointer while the pipe stays put: an attached Program's reference can
 * only be orphaned by destroying the pipe, which is what freeing its L1 looks like at the
 * call site. Wrap the pointer in a shared_ptr if several owners need to keep it alive.
 *
 * Host programming model:
 *   auto pipe = CreatePrefetcherPipe(device, sender_core, receiver_cores, ring_size);
 *   AttachPrefetcherPipe(program, pipe, sender_cores, entry_size);  // or all receivers
 *   // optional relay to TRISC: CreatePrefetcherPipeRelayDataflowBuffer(program, receivers, cfg, id),
 *   //   declared in impl/dataflow_buffer/prefetcher_pipe.hpp with the DFB config it takes.
 *
 * Device kernel flows (sender / receiver / relay) are documented on the device API:
 *   tt_metal/hw/inc/api/dataflow/prefetcher_pipe.h
