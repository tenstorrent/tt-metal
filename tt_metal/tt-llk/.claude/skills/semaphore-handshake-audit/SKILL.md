# /semaphore-handshake-audit — Inter-thread semaphore & mutex correctness

> **Ground-truth precedence:** the live ISA doc (tt-isa-docs MCP, fetched each run) outranks every rule, table, and example baked into this skill — treat those as dated illustrations. If the live ISA doc **contradicts** a baked rule here, do NOT silently proceed: surface the conflict to the user and ask whether the baked rule should be overwritten, discarded, or kept. Default to the ISA doc.
>
> **MANDATORY — before any verdict, read the shared grounding policy.** The per-architecture **source ladder** (which docs to consult), the **ground-or-abstain** rule, and the **Source preflight** (list the sources you'll consult with their reachability + hierarchy, then PAUSE for the user) are defined once in `race-audit-all` → `.claude/skills/race-audit-all/SKILL.md`. **Your FIRST action is to `Read` that file and follow its "Ground-truth source ladder", "Ground-or-abstain", and "Source preflight" sections** — they are load-bearing: a verdict produced without them is ungrounded and MUST NOT be reported. If that file genuinely cannot be read, say so and **abstain** rather than proceed ungrounded. (If you were spawned by a `race-audit-all` sweep — your prompt already lists the confirmed sources — skip the Source preflight and do not pause; the orchestrator ran it once.)
>
> **Coverage — floor, not ceiling.** The grep patterns and site lists in this skill are a **seed, not an exhaustive enumeration**. After running them, widen the search with full reasoning. The techniques here are **illustrative examples, not the allowed set** — use any approach your reasoning suggests, including ones not listed: e.g. semantic search (by behavior/effect, not just token), resolving macros / wrappers / typedefs / indirection the literal pattern can't match, following the call graph to callers and callees, and diffing the WH/BH/QSR variants to catch a site present in one arch and missing in another. If you can find a hazard, primitive, or site the encoded patterns don't cover — by any means — pursue and report it; do **not** clamp a stronger analysis to this list or to these techniques. State any residual coverage gaps explicitly (no silent caps).
>
> **Execution — parallel by default.** When enumeration yields more than a few sites/files, **fan out concurrent `Agent` calls by default** (one per file/subsystem, a fresh context each), saturating the available concurrency (~10–16 at once); go inline only for a trivial set. The per-file fan-out described under *Thoroughness* is the **default**, not an exhaustive-only option. The cross-referencing/synthesis of results stays sequential (it must follow the per-unit findings). The heavyweight **Workflow** tool still requires explicit multi-agent opt-in — it is the opt-in exhaustive tier, not the default. Don't over-spawn a tiny diff.
>
> **Persisting results — single writer, incremental.** Agents only **return** their findings; they never write a shared file (no concurrent-write clobbering). If findings are persisted to a file, the orchestrator/caller is the **sole writer** and **appends each wave's returns as they arrive** — incremental, never only-at-the-end — so an interrupt preserves every completed wave's findings.

## Recall preflight — run the `llk-audit` tool first (augmentor, not a verdict)
Get the deterministic candidate list before manual analysis:

    cd .claude/tools/llk-audit && ./run.sh <wormhole|blackhole|quasar> --checks semaphore-handshake
    # PR-scoped: add --changed [BASE] (default main) to report only findings touching a changed file.
    # candidates: out/audit.<arch>.json -> .checks["semaphore-handshake"].findings

`MUTEX_IMBALANCE` = a function whose acquire/release counts differ (wrapper defs
and RAII ctor/dtor are already excluded). `WAIT_WITHOUT_INIT` = a wait whose
identity has no matching **concrete** SEMINIT in the parsed tree — a **candidate
only** (the BRISC boot firmware inits Max out-of-tree, and the generic
`t6_sem(index)` wrapper can init any semaphore). A finding tagged
`safety: LOW_CONFIDENCE` means a generic init IS present and *may* cover it —
still surfaced, just lower priority; an untagged one has no init of any kind in
tree. Wait/init identity vocabularies (`semaphore::NAME` vs `p_stall::SEMAPHORE_n`)
don't reconcile statically, so treat every one as a lead to confirm, not a verdict.
The tool covers only these two mechanical signals; **widen for** cross-thread
post/get direction, cross-layer producers (ttnn/models), and deadlock cycles —
none of which it decides (see `blind_spots`). It never clears a site; you decide.
If unbuilt, proceed manually.

## The bug class (precise)
The three Tensix threads coordinate through **8 hardware semaphores** (`Semaphores[0..7]`, each a 4-bit `Value` 0–15 plus a `Max`) and **two ATGETM/ATRELM mutexes**. Unlike config-register races (covered by `cfg-word-overlap-audit`, `reconfig-stall-audit`, `mmio-race-audit`), these bugs are in the *handshake protocol*: a mis-initialized, unbalanced, wrong-direction, or wrongly-ordered post/wait/get → **lost synchronization (silent data corruption)** or **deadlock (TENSIX TIMED OUT)**.

## Ground-truth HW semantics (confirm via tt-isa-docs MCP: `SEMINIT.md`, `SEMWAIT.md`, `SEMPOST.md`, `SyncUnit.md`)
- `SEMPOST` → `Value++` **capped at 15** (HW). `SEMGET` → `Value--` **floored at 0**. Both silently no-op at the limit.
- `SEMWAIT(block_mask, sem_mask, cond)`: stalls the thread's instruction issue while the condition holds. `STALL_ON_MAX` = block **while `Value == Max`** (wait for a consumer to drain). `STALL_ON_ZERO` = block **while `Value == 0`** (wait for a producer to post).
- `SEMINIT(NewMax, NewValue, sem_mask)` sets **both `Value` and `Max`** atomically. **Crucial: `Max` is used ONLY by `SEMWAIT`; `SEMPOST` ignores it and still caps at 15.** So `Max` is purely the wait threshold — it does **not** bound posting. Backpressure exists only if the *producer* calls `wait_on_max` **before** each post.
- LLK wrappers (`ckernel.h`): `t6_semaphore_init(idx, min, max)` → `TTI_SEMINIT(max, min, …)` (so wrapper `min` = initial `Value`, `max` = `Max`). `t6_semaphore_post/get` are Tensix `SEMPOST/SEMGET` (in-stream, ordered). `semaphore_post/get` (no `t6_`) are **RISC MMIO** writes to `pc_buf_base[PC_BUF_SEMAPHORE_BASE+idx]` — asynchronous to the Tensix stream. The `LLK_ASSERT(value<MAX)` / `(value>0)` guards are **debug-only** → release builds silently over/underflow.

## What to check — and the rules

### 1. INIT correctness vs usage (do this FIRST — it's the most-missed)
- **Every semaphore used with `wait_on_max`/`STALL_ON_MAX` MUST be `SEMINIT`'d with `Max` = the intended buffer depth**, by one thread, *before any thread uses it*. If it relies on the HW-reset default `Max`, the producer's backpressure gate is wrong → over-post (silent corruption) or premature/never block.
  - In-tree, only `MATH_PACK` is `SEMINIT`'d inside tt-llk: `_llk_math_pack_sync_init_` (`llk_math_common.h`) sets `Max=1` (`DstSync::SyncFull`) or `Max=2` (`SyncHalf`), `Value=0`. **`UNPACK_TO_DEST`, `MATH_DONE`, `PACK_DONE` have no `SEMINIT` in tt-llk** — they are boot-initialized by **BRISC firmware**, not the compute-API startup. Ground truth (verified): `brisc.cc` → `c_tensix_core::initialize_tensix_semaphores()` (`tt_metal/hw/inc/internal/.../c_tensix_core.h`) runs once before any TRISC kernel and issues `ex_sem_init(sem, max, value)` = `Max=1, Value=0`. **On WH/BH it inits four** — `MATH_PACK`, `UNPACK_TO_DEST`, `MATH_DONE`, `PACK_DONE`; **on Quasar only three** — `MATH_PACK`, `UNPACK_TO_DEST`, `MATH_DONE` (there is **no `PACK_DONE`** semaphore on Quasar). So those are depth-1 by default and init-ordered before use; `MATH_PACK` is then re-`SEMINIT`'d per `DstSync` mode by `_llk_math_pack_sync_init_`. The LLK **test** harness approximates this in `tests/helpers/include/boot.h`, but via `t6_semaphore_init` (SEMINIT) and for a DIFFERENT subset — `UNPACK_TO_DEST`, `MATH_DONE`, `PACK_DONE` (NOT `MATH_PACK`, which the compute path re-inits) — so do not treat `boot.h` as a byte-for-byte copy of the firmware init. When auditing, confirm any NEW wait-on-max semaphore is added to `initialize_tensix_semaphores` (or re-init'd in LLK); flag any wait-on-max semaphore with no reachable `SEMINIT` in BRISC firmware **or** tt-llk.
- **Initial `Value` must match the empty/full convention** — producer/consumer semaphores start at `Value=0` (empty). A stale non-zero value (no re-init across kernels, or across a `DstSync` mode switch) desyncs from cycle one.
- **The issuing thread + ordering**: semaphores are thread-agnostic (single bank), but `SEMINIT` executes in one thread's stream. It must land before any thread's first wait/post/get. Verify the init barrier (e.g. `_llk_math_pack_sync_init_` does `tensix_sync()` + `while(semaphore_read(MATH_PACK)>0){}` to drain prior packs **before** re-`SEMINIT`). Missing barrier → init races a peer still using the old value.
- **Mode-switch re-init**: `SyncFull`↔`SyncHalf` need `Max` 1↔2. Changing dest-sync mode without re-`SEMINIT` (and a dest drain) leaves `Max` mismatched to the real buffer depth.
- `Max` ≤ 15 and ≥ the deepest outstanding count the producer can post between waits. Since `SEMPOST` ignores `Max`, ALSO confirm usage rule #2.

### 2. Post/get (producer/consumer) balance
- Exactly **one `SEMGET` per `SEMPOST`** over any complete iteration. Walk every branch: a post inside an `if` whose get is unconditional (or vice-versa), or an early `return`/`continue` between them, drifts `Value` → producer eventually wedges at `Max` forever (deadlock) or consumer drains a slot that was never filled.
- Because `SEMPOST` ignores `Max`, **every producer post must be preceded (in that thread's program order) by the `wait_on_max` gate** — that gate is the only thing preventing overshoot past the intended depth. A post on a path that skips the wait → silent overflow toward 15.
- **Cross-layer handshakes (don't false-flag a deadlock):** for experimental/custom ops, the producer and consumer halves can live in **different layers** — an LLK function may provide only one half (e.g. a `wait_on_zero`+`get`) while the matching `post` is issued by the **compute kernel / model layer** (`ttnn/cpp/.../kernels/...`, `models/.../kernel_includes/...`, `tt_metal/hw/inc/api/compute/...`), exactly like `MATH_PACK`'s halves sit in `cmath`/`cpack` but are assembled by the compute API. So a `wait_on_zero` with **no producer in tt-llk is NOT automatically a deadlock** — chase the producer repo-wide (`grep -rIn '<SEM>' ttnn models tt_metal/hw/inc/api`) before flagging. Only call it a deadlock if no reachable layer posts it.

### 3. Wait-direction
- Producer side waits `STALL_ON_MAX` (block while full); consumer side waits `STALL_ON_ZERO` (block while empty), then `SEMGET`. Swapped condition → either no synchronization (proceeds immediately) or permanent stall. Canonical good pair: math `wait_on_max`→compute→`post(MATH_PACK)`; pack `wait_on_zero`→pack→`get(MATH_PACK)`.

### 4. RISC-MMIO vs Tensix-instruction ordering
- `semaphore_post`/`semaphore_get` (no `t6_`) are RISC stores that execute asynchronously to the Tensix stream (overlaps `/mmio-race-audit`). When a RISC `semaphore_post` is meant to gate a Tensix consumer, there must be a `SEMWAIT`/`TTI_SEMGET` that actually stalls on it (the `UNPACK_SYNC` context-acquire idiom: RISC `semaphore_post` → `STALLWAIT(STALL_UNPACK, TRISC_CFG)` → MOP → `t6_semaphore_get`). A bare MMIO post/get with no in-stream wait can land early/late. On **Quasar**, HW AutoTTSync changes these RISC↔Tensix ordering rules (read Confluence `1340276980` at audit for what it actually orders; see `/mmio-race-audit`) — don't apply WH/BH manual-ordering verdicts blindly.
- **Ordering vs a paired blocking `mailbox_write`:** when a producer releases the consumer with a `semaphore_post` AND hands data via a `mailbox_write` in the same path, the `semaphore_post` must come **first** — a full mailbox FIFO can stall the producer before it posts, deadlocking against the waiting consumer (→ `mailbox-sync-audit`, signal-before-blocking-write).

### 5. Mutex (ATGETM/ATRELM) balance & deadlock
- `t6_mutex_acquire(idx)`/`t6_mutex_release(idx)` (`mutex::REG_RMW`=0, `mutex::SFPU`=4) must be **balanced on every path** — an early return between acquire and release holds the mutex and **deadlocks every other thread** that acquires it. The mutex only helps parties that take it (`REG_RMW` is **not** taken by the math thread — see `cfg-word-overlap-audit`).
- `mutex::SFPU` is **declared but currently never acquired** in tt-llk. It exists because SFPU instructions can issue from both T1 and T2; if a kernel ever issues SFPU from pack concurrently with math without taking it → race. Flag any new cross-thread SFPU issue that doesn't.

### 6. Cross-thread deadlock cycle
- Build the wait-for graph: math waits `MATH_PACK`-max (needs pack `get`) and `UNPACK_TO_DEST`-zero (needs unpack `post`); pack waits `MATH_PACK`-zero (needs math `post`); unpack waits `UNPACK_TO_DEST`-max (needs math `get`). Any cycle with no thread able to make progress = deadlock. Most often introduced by reordering wait-before-work, or an op that posts on one thread whose consumer is conditionally skipped, or mismatched init/uninit pairing across threads.

## Method
1. **Enumerate** every site, tagged by thread via filename (`*unpack*`/`cunpack`=T0, `*math*`/`cmath`=T1, `*pack*`/`cpack`=T2):
   ```bash
   # in-tree ops — from the repo root
   grep -rInE "t6_semaphore_(post|get|wait_on_max|wait_on_zero|init)|semaphore_(post|get|read)\(|TTI?_SEM(POST|GET|WAIT|INIT)|t6_mutex_(acquire|release)|TTI?_ATGETM|TTI?_ATRELM" \
     tt_metal/tt-llk/tt_llk_* --include=*.h | grep -v /tests/
   # init sites, incl. ABOVE tt-llk (kernels/firmware do some SEMINIT — e.g.
   # brisc.cc initialize_tensix_semaphores()); ALSO from the repo root:
   grep -rInE "SEMINIT|t6_semaphore_init|initialize_tensix_semaphores" tt_metal/hw tt_metal/tt-llk ttnn/cpp models --include=*.h --include=*.cc --include=*.cpp | grep -v /tests/
   ```
2. **Per semaphore**, list every (thread, op, condition, file:line). Classify ops: `SEMINIT`(Max,Value) / `SEMPOST`(producer) / `SEMGET`(consumer) / `SEMWAIT`(max|zero) / RISC-MMIO post|get.
3. **Run the rules**: init present + correct Max/Value (#1) → balance over all branches (#2) → directions (#3) → MMIO ordering (#4) → mutex balance (#5) → deadlock graph (#6).
4. **Confirm semantics** against tt-isa-docs (WH/BH) when unsure what a `SEMWAIT` condition or `Max` does.

## Verdict
- **Init present (right thread, right Max/Value, ordered before use) + balanced post/get on all paths + correct directions + MMIO posts gated by an in-stream wait + mutexes balanced + no wait cycle** → SAFE.
- **Wait-on-max semaphore with no reachable `SEMINIT`, or Max ≠ buffer depth, or stale initial Value** → INIT-BUG (corruption or deadlock depending on default).
- **Post/get imbalance or skipped wait-before-post on a reachable branch** → RACE/DEADLOCK (real).
- **Window exists only on an unused/experimental path, or value-invariant** → LATENT — say so; let the maintainer decide.

## Architecture note
WH/BH share this model. **Quasar** adds HW AutoTTSync affecting RISC↔Tensix ordering (read Confluence `1340276980` at audit for its guarantees), so rule #4 verdicts differ; the semaphore-protocol rules (#1–#3, #5–#6) still apply. Verify the semaphore map/wrappers resolve for Quasar before concluding.

## Verified non-bugs (don't re-flag)
- `deepseek_compute_kernel_init` (`tt_metal/hw/inc/api/compute/experimental/deepseek_compute_kernel_hw_startup.h`): `MATH` inits `FPU_SFPU` (sem 0), `PACK` inits `SFPU_FPU` (= `UNPACK_MATH_DONE`, sem 6). Different semaphores **on purpose** — a two-semaphore bidirectional FPU↔SFPU handshake (documented in its `@note`), not a typo.
- `UNPACK_TO_DEST` / `MATH_DONE` having no `SEMINIT` *inside tt-llk* is **not** a missing-init bug: BRISC firmware `c_tensix_core::initialize_tensix_semaphores()` boot-inits them (and `MATH_PACK`) to `Max=1, Value=0` before any TRISC kernel — plus `PACK_DONE` **on WH/BH only** (Quasar has no `PACK_DONE` semaphore; see line 65). In particular `MATH_DONE`'s `wait_on_max` is a real depth-1 gate (Max=1), not a no-op — do not assume a default `Max` of 15.
- `FPU_SFPU` (sem 0) in the experimental `llk_unpack_AB_reduce_custom*.h` is **consumer-only** (`wait_on_zero`+`get`, "wait for blocked_matmul_and_pack to signal") — **not** a missing-producer deadlock. The matching `post` is issued by the compute-kernel layer (e.g. `sdpa.h`/`custom_tilize.h` MATH `post`, `llk_math_sdpa_custom_mm.h`, driven by `blocked_matmul_and_pack<>` in `sparse_sdpa_compute.cpp`); init via the deepseek startup (`Max=1`). Classic cross-layer handshake.

## Thoroughness (optional, full sweep)
Best done as: deterministic enumeration (grep → per-semaphore table) → one agent per semaphore to run rules #1–#6 → **adversarial verify**: for each SAFE verdict, try to construct a branch/order that breaks balance or deadlocks; for each wait-on-max semaphore, try to prove its `SEMINIT` is unreachable. Only run a Workflow if the user opts into multi-agent orchestration. Never upgrade "balanced in the common path" to SAFE without checking early-return/conditional paths.

## Output
For each semaphore/mutex: the per-thread op table (`file:line`), `SEMINIT` Max/Value + issuing thread + whether ordered before use, balance result, wait-directions, MMIO-ordering, and verdict (SAFE / INIT-BUG / RACE-DEADLOCK / LATENT) with one-line reasoning + fix. End with a wait-for-graph note (any cycle) and totals per verdict per arch.
