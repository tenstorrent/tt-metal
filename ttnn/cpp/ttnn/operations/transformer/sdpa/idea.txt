Multi-Device Causal Attention Optimization with Ring-Based Query Distribution

⚠️ CRITICAL TILE DIMENSION FIX (2024-08-27):
Fixed incorrect tile dimension assumptions. Tenstorrent uses 32x32 tiles (TILE_HEIGHT=32),
requiring minimum S=256 for 8 tiles to work with ring_size=4. Updated all examples
from S=32 to S=256. Previous tests failed due to insufficient positions per chunk.

Problem Overview
We have a scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) kernel that needs to be optimized for multi-device execution. Currently, when running causal attention across multiple devices, each device redundantly computes the full attention matrix, including many zeros due to the causal mask. We want to distribute the computation more efficiently by having each device compute only a subset of query positions.
Current Setup
Hardware Configuration :
Mesh topology: (8, 4) shape
8-way parallelism for attention heads
4-way parallelism available for sequence-level optimization
Total of 32 devices, but we're focusing on the 4-device dimension
 Current Implementation :
Each device has the full Q, K, V tensors replicated
Each device computes the full attention independently
Significant redundant computation due to causal masking
 Proposed Solution: Ring-Based Query Distribution
Core Concept
Instead of each device computing all queries, we distribute queries across devices in a "ring" pattern that balances computational load. In causal attention, later queries attend to more keys (more computation), while earlier queries attend to fewer keys (less computation).
Distribution Pattern
For a sequence of length S with 4 devices (ring_size = 4):
Split sequence into 8 chunks (2 * ring_size)
Each device gets 2 chunks: one from the first half, one from the second half
This pairs "cheap" early queries with "expensive" late queries for load balancing
 Example for S=256, ring_size=4 (CORRECTED FOR 32x32 TILE SYSTEM):
Device 0 (ring_id=0): chunks 0 and 7 → positions [0-31] and [224-255] (1 tile each)
Device 1 (ring_id=1): chunks 1 and 6 → positions [32-63] and [192-223] (1 tile each)
Device 2 (ring_id=2): chunks 2 and 5 → positions [64-95] and [160-191] (1 tile each)
Device 3 (ring_id=3): chunks 3 and 4 → positions [96-127] and [128-159] (1 tile each)
 Chunk Calculation Formula
For a device with ring_id in a ring_size ring:
chunk_size = S / (2 * ring_size)
First chunk index: ring_id
Second chunk index: (2 * ring_size - 1) - ring_id
Query positions:
First chunk: [ring_id * chunk_size, (ring_id + 1) * chunk_size)
Second chunk: [((2 * ring_size - 1) - ring_id) * chunk_size, ((2 * ring_size) - ring_id) * chunk_size)
 Required Implementation Changes
1. Add Compile-Time Arguments
Add two new compile-time arguments to the kernel:
ring_size: Number of devices in the ring (in our case, 4)
ring_id: This device's position in the ring (0-3)
 2. Modify Query Chunk Selection
Currently, the kernel uses:
cpp
Save
Copy
1
2
3
4
5
#if defined BALANCED_Q_PARALLEL
    // Current load balancing logic
#else
    q_chunk = local_q_start + q_iter;
#endif
This needs to be modified to:
Calculate which two chunk ranges this device should handle based on ring_id and ring_size
Map the iteration index to the appropriate chunk from these two ranges
 3. Implement Computation Skipping
The key optimization is to skip computation when we know the result will be zeros due to causal masking:
For causal attention, query at position q can only attend to keys at positions 0 through q. This means:
For a query chunk at positions [q_low, q_high)
And a key chunk at positions [k_low, k_high)
If q_low >= k_high, the entire QK block will be zeros and can be skipped
 Currently, the kernel checks if (!(q_low_idx >= k_high_idx)) only for mask addition. We need to:
Move this check earlier in the loop
Skip the entire QK computation block when this condition is false
Initialize the corresponding output block with zeros or skip its contribution
 4. Custom Causal Mask Generation
The current implementation generates a simple upper triangular mask when is_causal=true. With ring-based distribution, each device needs a custom mask because its queries are non-contiguous.
The mask for each device should:
Have shape [local_num_queries, total_sequence_length]
For each local query at global position q, allow attention to positions [0, q]
Be generated in the reader kernel and passed through cb_mask_in
 Expected Benefits
Computation Reduction : Each device only computes ~25% of the full attention matrix
Load Balancing : The ring distribution ensures each device has similar computational load despite causal masking
Memory Efficiency : Reduced intermediate activation storage per device
Near 4x Speedup : With proper implementation, should approach theoretical 4x speedup for the attention computation
 Implementation Notes
The BALANCED_Q_PARALLEL flag in the current code shows there's already infrastructure for alternative query distribution schemes
The existing ping-pong buffer pattern (alias_prev/cur) should work unchanged with the new distribution
Care must be taken to ensure the output chunks are in the correct order for subsequent operations

Output Handling Strategy
Each device will write its computed outputs contiguously in the order it processes queries (first chunk results, then second chunk results). At the model level, an all-gather operation will collect results from all devices, followed by reshuffling to restore the correct sequence order. This keeps the SDPA operation device-independent while handling coordination at a higher level.

API Design Decision
The ring-distributed SDPA is CAUSAL-ONLY and does not accept custom attention masks. This design choice simplifies the implementation since:
1. The optimization specifically leverages causal sparsity patterns
2. Custom masks would complicate ring distribution and reduce computational savings
3. Each device generates its own causal mask internally for its non-contiguous query positions
4. This keeps the API focused and the implementation clean

Complete Implementation Checklist for Ring-Distributed Causal SDPA

Note: This implementation takes a simplified approach by reusing the existing SDPAProgramConfig
and passing ring_size and ring_id as direct parameters to the program factory, rather than
creating an extended configuration struct. This follows existing patterns and reduces complexity.

1. New API & Python Integration
- [x] **New Operation Class**: `ExecuteRingDistributedScaledDotProductAttention`
- [x] **New PyBind Registration**: Add to `sdpa_pybind.cpp` with ring parameters
- [x] **Python API**: Accept `ring_size` and `ring_id` parameters from user

  ```cpp
  tt::tt_metal::operation::ProgramWithCallbacks ring_sdpa_multi_core(
      const Tensor& q, const Tensor& k, const Tensor& v, const Tensor& output,
      uint32_t ring_size, uint32_t ring_id,  // Direct parameters
      std::optional<float> scale, bool is_causal,
      std::optional<SDPAProgramConfig> program_config  // Reuse existing config
  );
  ```
- [x] **Ring Distribution Logic**: Calculate which Q chunks each device processes
  - Device gets chunks: `[ring_id, (2*ring_size-1)-ring_id]`
  - Map to actual sequence positions
- [x] **Compile-Time Args**: Add `ring_size`, `ring_id` to all kernel compile args
- [x] **Runtime Args**: Calculate device-specific `local_q_start`, `local_q_end` based on ring distribution
- [x] **Parallelization Scheme**: Adapt existing parallelization for ring distribution
- [x] **Config Reuse**: Use existing `SDPAProgramConfig` for kernel configuration
- [x] **Memory Layout Planning**: Determine output tensor organization

3. New Compute Kernel (PRIORITY: Do after writer kernel)
- [x] **New File**: `device/kernels/compute/ring_sdpa.cpp`
- [x] **Ring Q Chunk Selection**: Replace existing Q chunk mapping logic with mutually exclusive load balancing
  ```cpp
  #if defined RING_Q_DISTRIBUTION
      // Ring distribution provides global load balancing across devices
      uint32_t global_q_chunk = (q_iter == 0) ? first_chunk_id : second_chunk_id;
      q_chunk = global_q_chunk;
  #elif defined BALANCED_Q_PARALLEL
      // Per-core load balancing (disabled when using ring distribution)
      uint32_t q_chunk_div_2 = q_chunks_per_core / 2;
      if (q_iter < q_chunk_div_2) {
          q_chunk = local_q_start + q_iter;
      } else {
          uint32_t back_q_iter = q_iter - q_chunk_div_2;
          q_chunk = q_num_chunks - 1 - (local_q_start + back_q_iter);
      }
  #else
      q_chunk = local_q_start + q_iter;  // Simple consecutive processing
  #endif
  ```
  - **Mutually Exclusive**: Ring distribution and balanced Q parallel cannot be active simultaneously
  - **Global vs Local**: Ring handles load balancing globally, balanced Q handles it per-core
- [x] **Early Computation Skipping**: Move causal check before expensive operations
  ```cpp
  // Always check causal constraint (no is_causal conditionals - always true)
  bool should_compute = !(q_low_idx >= k_high_idx);
  if (should_compute) {
      // Execute normal FlashAttention: QK matmul, max, exp, sum, attention output
      // Include all buffer swaps and accumulation logic
  }
  // Skipped blocks contribute zero automatically via FlashAttention's online algorithm
  ```
- [x] **Causal-Only Simplification**: Remove `is_causal`, `use_provided_mask`, `use_padded_mask` conditionals
  - Ring SDPA is causal-only by design - no need for runtime mask type checks
  - Cleaner code with fewer branches and better performance
  - Writer kernel handles all mask generation
- [x] **Buffer Management**: Skip ALL operations (computation + buffer swaps) for skipped K chunks
  - When `should_compute = false`: skip matmul, reduce, exp, output accumulation, AND buffer swaps
  - Maintains proper ping-pong buffer state for subsequent iterations
  - Running statistics (max, sum) naturally handle skipped chunks
- [x] **Ring Compile-time Arguments**: Add ring distribution parameters
  ```cpp
  constexpr uint32_t ring_size = get_compile_time_arg_val(X);
  constexpr uint32_t ring_id = get_compile_time_arg_val(X+1);
  constexpr uint32_t first_chunk_id = get_compile_time_arg_val(X+2);
  constexpr uint32_t second_chunk_id = get_compile_time_arg_val(X+3);
  ```

DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION WALKTHROUGH
==============================================================================

Example Setup for Analysis (CORRECTED FOR TILE SYSTEM):
- Sequence Length (S): 256 positions = 8 tiles (32 positions per tile, TILE_HEIGHT=32)
- Ring Size: 4 devices (ring_id: 0, 1, 2, 3)
- Chunk Size: S / (2 × ring_size) = 256 / 8 = 32 positions = 1 tile per chunk
- Focus Device: Device 0 (ring_id = 0)
- Device 0 Assignment: chunks 0 and 7 → positions [0-31] and [224-255] (1 tile each)

Ring Distribution Pattern:
  Device 0: chunks [0, 7] → positions [0-3, 28-31]   (early + late)
  Device 1: chunks [1, 6] → positions [4-7, 24-27]   (early + late)
  Device 2: chunks [2, 5] → positions [8-11, 20-23]  (early + late)
  Device 3: chunks [3, 4] → positions [12-15, 16-19] (middle + middle)

Key Compile-Time Arguments (Device 0):
- ring_size = 4, ring_id = 0
- first_chunk_id = 0, second_chunk_id = 7
- global_chunk_size = 4 (positions), global_chunk_size_t = 1 (tile)
- local_q_num_chunks = 2 (always for ring distribution)
- Sq_chunk_t = 1, Sk_chunk_t = 1 (tiles per chunk)

==============================================================================
STEP 1: RING READER KERNEL (ring_reader.cpp)
==============================================================================

Purpose: Read Q, K, V data for Device 0's assigned query chunks (0 and 7)

Circular Buffers:
- cb_q_in (c_0): Stores Q tiles for current chunk processing
- cb_k_in (c_1): Stores K tiles for current attention computation
- cb_v_in (c_2): Stores V tiles for current attention computation
- cb_mask_in (c_3): Receives causal masks from writer kernel (unused in reader)

Key Variables:
- local_q_chunks_per_core = 2 (Device 0 processes 2 chunks)
- q_tile_shape: [B, NQH, 8, DHt] (global tensor shape for tile indexing)
- k_tile_shape: [B, NKH, 8, DHt] (global K tensor shape)
- barrier_threshold: NOC synchronization parameter for memory reads

Processing Flow:
for batch nb in [0, B):
  for head nq in [0, NQH):
    for local_q_iter in [0, 2):  # Device 0 processes 2 Q chunks

      Step 1.1: Map Local to Global Chunk
      - local_q_chunk_index = local_q_start + local_q_iter = 0 + local_q_iter
      - if local_q_iter == 0: global_q_chunk = first_chunk_id = 0
      - if local_q_iter == 1: global_q_chunk = second_chunk_id = 7

      Step 1.2: Calculate Global Q Positions
      - global_q_start = global_q_chunk * global_chunk_size_t
        * local_q_iter=0: global_q_start = 0 * 1 = 0 (tile index)
        * local_q_iter=1: global_q_start = 7 * 1 = 7 (tile index)

        * Reads 1 tile of Q data into cb_q_in
        * For local_q_iter=0: reads positions [0-31] (tile 0)
        * For local_q_iter=1: reads positions [224-255] (tile 7)

      Step 1.4: Calculate Causal K Range
      - q_high_idx = global_q_end = global_q_start + 1 (in tile units)
        * local_q_iter=0: q_high_idx = 1 (can attend to K tile 0 only)
        * local_q_iter=1: q_high_idx = 8 (can attend to K tiles 0-7)

      Step 1.5: Read Required K and V Chunks
      for k_chunk in [0, q_high_idx):
        - k_start_tile_id = k_tile_shape.id_of(nb, kv_head, k_chunk, 0)
        - read_chunk_with_padding(k_reader, cb_k_in, k_start_tile_id, 1 tile, ..., transpose=true)
        - read_chunk_with_padding(v_reader, cb_v_in, k_start_tile_id, 1 tile, ...)

        For local_q_iter=0 (chunk 0): reads K/V for k_chunk=0 only
        For local_q_iter=1 (chunk 7): reads K/V for k_chunk=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

        * local_q_iter=1: q_high_idx = 8 (attend to K tiles 0-7)

      for k_chunk in [0, q_high_idx):
        - if !(q_low_idx >= k_high_idx):  # Skip if no attention needed
          * generate_causal_mask<cb_mask_in>(Sq_chunk_t, Sk_chunk_t, global_q_chunk, k_chunk)
          * Creates mask for Q chunk global_q_chunk attending to K chunk k_chunk
          * Mask format: upper triangular within valid attention range

      For local_q_iter=0: generates 1 mask (Q chunk 0 → K chunk 0)
      For local_q_iter=1: generates 8 masks (Q chunk 7 → K chunks 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

      Step 2.3: Write Contiguous Output
      - local_output_q_pos = local_q_iter - local_q_start = local_q_iter
      - out_tile_id = output_tensor.tile_id(nb, nq, local_output_q_pos, 0)
      - noc_async_write_tile(cb_out, out_tile_id, ...)
        * local_q_iter=0: writes to local position 0 (chunk 0 results)
        * local_q_iter=1: writes to local position 1 (chunk 7 results)

      Step 3.3: Initialize Ping-Pong Buffers
      - alias_prev_max = cb_max_A, alias_cur_max = cb_max_B
      - alias_prev_sum = cb_sum_A, alias_cur_sum = cb_sum_B
      - alias_mm2_prev_out = cb_out_im_A, alias_mm2_cur_out = cb_out_im_B

      Step 3.4: Wait for Q Data from Reader
      - cb_wait_front(cb_q_in, q_chunk_tiles)
        * Waits for reader to provide Q tile for current chunk

      Step 3.5: Process K Chunks with Early Termination
      for k_chunk in [0, ∞) while (k_chunk * Sk_chunk_t < q_high_idx):

        Step 3.5.1: Calculate K Range
        - k_low_idx = k_chunk * Sk_chunk_t = k_chunk * 1 = k_chunk
        - k_high_idx = k_low_idx + Sk_chunk_t = k_chunk + 1

        Step 3.5.2: Early Computation Skipping (KEY OPTIMIZATION!)
        - should_compute = !(q_low_idx >= k_high_idx)

        For q_iter=0 (chunk 0, q_low_idx=0):
          * k_chunk=0: should_compute = !(0 >= 1) = true → COMPUTE
          * Loop terminates because k_chunk=1 gives (1*1 >= 1) → false

        For q_iter=1 (chunk 7, q_low_idx=7):
          * k_chunk=0: should_compute = !(7 >= 1) = false → SKIP
          * k_chunk=1: should_compute = !(7 >= 2) = false → SKIP
          * ...
          * k_chunk=6: should_compute = !(7 >= 7) = false → SKIP
          * k_chunk=7: should_compute = !(7 >= 8) = true → COMPUTE
          * Loop terminates because k_chunk=8 gives (8*1 >= 8) → false

        Step 3.5.3: FlashAttention Computation (when should_compute = true)
        if (should_compute):
          a) QK Matrix Multiplication:
             - cb_wait_front(cb_k_in, k_chunk_tiles)
             - matmul_blocks(cb_q_in, cb_k_in, cb_qk_im, ...)
             - Result: Q[chunk] × K[chunk]^T → cb_qk_im

          b) Apply Causal Mask:
             - cb_wait_front(cb_mask_in, qk_chunk_tiles)
             - add_block_inplace(cb_qk_im, cb_mask_in, qk_chunk_tiles)
             - Result: Masked QK scores → cb_qk_im

          c) Max Reduction (for numerical stability):
             - reduce_c<MAX>(cb_qk_im, cb_identity_scale_in, alias_cur_max, alias_prev_max, k_chunk > 0)
             - Result: Running max for softmax → alias_cur_max

          d) Subtract Max, Scale, Exp (online softmax):
             - sub_exp_block_bcast_cols_inplace<cb_qk_im>(alias_cur_max, alias_cur_sum)
             - Result: exp(QK - max) and running sum → cb_qk_im, alias_cur_sum

          e) Attention Output Computation:
             - cb_wait_front(cb_v_in, v_chunk_tiles)
             - matmul_blocks(cb_qk_im, cb_v_in, alias_mm2_cur_out, ...)
             - Result: Softmax(QK) × V → alias_mm2_cur_out

          f) Online Accumulation:
             - Combine with previous outputs using exp(max_diff) weighting
             - Result: Running weighted attention output

          g) Ping-Pong Buffer Swap:
             - Swap alias_prev_max ↔ alias_cur_max
             - Swap alias_prev_sum ↔ alias_cur_sum
             - Swap alias_mm2_prev_out ↔ alias_mm2_cur_out

        Step 3.5.4: Buffer Management (when should_compute = false)
        - Skip ALL operations: no matmul, no buffer waits, no swaps
        - FlashAttention's online algorithm naturally handles skipped contributions
        - Running max/sum statistics remain valid for final normalization

      Step 3.6: Final Normalization and Output
      - Normalize final attention output using accumulated max/sum statistics
      - cb_push_back(cb_out, out_chunk_tiles) → Send to writer kernel

Data Flow Summary:
Reader CBs (cb_q_in, cb_k_in, cb_v_in) → FlashAttention Computation →
Writer CBs (cb_mask_in) → Masked Computation → Final cb_out → Writer

EXECUTION TRACE FOR DEVICE 0 (Example)
==============================================================================

Device 0 processes Q chunks 0 and 7:

Q Chunk 0 (positions [0-3], q_low_idx=0, q_high_idx=1):
├─ K Chunk 0 (positions [0-3]): should_compute = !(0 >= 1) = TRUE
│  ├─ QK computation: Q[0-3] × K[0-3]^T
│  ├─ Causal mask: allow positions [0] → [0], [1] → [0,1], [2] → [0,1,2], [3] → [0,1,2,3]
│  ├─ Attention: masked_softmax(QK) × V[0-3]
│  └─ Result: attention output for positions [0-3]
└─ K Chunks 1-7: Skipped (no valid K chunks because q_high_idx=1)

Q Chunk 7 (positions [28-31], q_low_idx=7, q_high_idx=8):
├─ K Chunks 0-6: should_compute = !(7 >= k_high_idx) = FALSE → SKIPPED
├─ K Chunk 7 (positions [28-31]): should_compute = !(7 >= 8) = TRUE
│  ├─ QK computation: Q[28-31] × K[28-31]^T
│  ├─ Causal mask: allow [28] → [0-28], [29] → [0-29], [30] → [0-30], [31] → [0-31]
│  ├─ But we only compute with K[28-31], so effective mask is upper triangular
│  ├─ Attention: masked_softmax(QK) × V[28-31]
│  └─ Result: attention output for positions [28-31]
└─ K Chunks 8+: Loop terminates

Final Device 0 Output:
- Local position 0: attention results for global positions [0-3] (chunk 0)
- Local position 1: attention results for global positions [28-31] (chunk 7)

Model-Level All-Gather & Reshuffle:
Device outputs: [Dev0: chunks 0,7], [Dev1: chunks 1,6], [Dev2: chunks 2,5], [Dev3: chunks 3,4]
After reshuffle: [chunk 0, chunk 1, chunk 2, chunk 3, chunk 4, chunk 5, chunk 6, chunk 7]
Global positions: [0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, 16-19, 20-23, 24-27, 28-31] → Original order restored!

==============================================================================
KEY OPTIMIZATIONS ACHIEVED
==============================================================================

1. **Computation Reduction**:
   - Device 0 only processes 2 out of 8 K chunks for Q chunk 7
   - Total K chunks processed: 1 (for Q chunk 0) + 1 (for Q chunk 7) = 2 out of 16
   - ~87% reduction in QK computations compared to full attention

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Device 0: 1 + 1 = 2 K chunk computations
   - Each device gets similar computational load despite causal masking
   - "Cheap" early Q chunks balanced with "expensive" late Q chunks

3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Each device stores only local sequence length (8 vs 32 positions)
   - Reduced intermediate activation storage
   - Contiguous output writing for efficient all-gather

4. **Early Termination**:
   - should_compute check prevents unnecessary QK matrix multiplications
   - Skip entire FlashAttention pipeline for zero blocks
   - Maintains numerical correctness through online algorithm properties
