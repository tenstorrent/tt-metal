"""v1 (from v0-cand1): parallel refine + gap-to-leader pruning.

Prefix signals: each branch's anchor (best valid score on it) and the round's
best valid score so far.
Batch rule: step 1 opens W branches from the root. Later steps refine every
open branch, except that a branch whose anchor trails the round leader by more
than gap(beta) (relative, in multiples of noise_pct) is closed. A dip on a
branch never closes it by itself: the anchor, not the head, is compared, so a
regression followed by a repair keeps its slot. A branch with no valid result
yet has no anchor and is never gap-closed (failures are normally repairable).
Beta: gap = noise_pct * (2 + 8*beta); higher beta keeps weaker branches longer.
Plan: campaign defaults (W, R); one recorded round, nothing wider is in support.
