# MiniMax-H3 FL2VA on BH Galaxy 4x8 — execution state

Plan (source of truth for scope, order, contracts, gates):
`~/.claude/plans/elegant-wibbling-brooks.md`. Re-read both before every iteration.

Branch: `kevinmi/minimax-h3`, based on `c63d43b89ec`.
All PRs target `kevinmi/minimax-h3`.

## Branch base — read before any git operation

The branch was cut in place from `kevinmi/optimizer/rjsdpa-split-forward-2026-07-07`
rather than from `main`, because the working tree carries **5 uncommitted tracked
modifications that belong to that rjsdpa work, not to H3**:

```
models/tt_dit/layers/normalization.py
models/tt_dit/models/transformers/ltx/attention_ltx.py
ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/experimental/ccl/CMakeLists.txt
ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/experimental/ccl/ccl_experimental_nanobind.cpp
ttnn/sources.cmake
```

Plus untracked, also not H3: `benchmarks/`, `update_spi_data_table_glx`,
`models/tt_dit/tests/models/ltx/test_perf_ltx_layer_tpsp.py`.

**Never `git add -A`, never reset, never rebase over these.** Stage H3 paths
explicitly. Rebasing onto `main` is a decision for the user once that WIP is
resolved.

## Current milestone

**M4 complete** — first successful device milestone. Host contracts (M2, M3) and
the DiT weight load (M4) are all green.

**Milestone order changed by user directive (2026-08-03): the VAEs come next**,
ahead of the DiT forward and the text encoder. Video VAE decode + encode and
audio VAE decode + encode, then back to M5/M6/M7. Good call independently: the
ViT decoder was the plan's largest unknown, and the VAEs gate any visible output.

Revised order: **M8 (VAEs) -> M5 (attention PCC) -> M6 (full DiT forward) ->
M7 (Qwen3-VL) -> M9 (e2e) -> M10 (trace) -> M11 (canonical) -> M12 (perf + A/B)**.

## Gate evidence

## Measurements recorded

From M2, on host (no device):

- Canonical 1344x768 / 192f / first+last keyframe: `used=61109`, padded 61440
  (0.54% waste @ `k_chunk=512`), M=3 unique timesteps, 6 global AdaLN runs,
  per-SP-shard runs `[6,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]` mean 1.75.
- Bringup 960x544 / 124f / first+last: `used=21301`, padded 24576 (**13.3%**
  waste @ `k_chunk=512`), 22528 (5.45%) @ `k_chunk=256`.
- `t2va` canonical: M=2, 3 global runs, mean 1.38 runs/shard.
- Shape algebra confirmed: 192f -> 57 latent frames, 320 audio latents;
  124f -> 37 latent frames, 207 audio latents.

## Checkpoint verification (M1, header-only reads, no device)

`FL2VA/transformer`: **535 tensors, 66.3 GB**. Every key name the plan assumed is
present and nothing else is: `blocks.{0..49}.{norm1,norm2,attn.{qkv_proj,out_proj,
q_norm,k_norm},mlp.{fc1,fc2},adaln_proj.linear}`, `token_refiner.blocks.{0,1}.*`
(no adaln, as expected) + `token_refiner.final_norm`, `final_layer.{norm,
adaln_proj.linear,video_out,audio_out}`, `{video,audio}_patch_proj`,
`condition_proj`, `time_embedder.proj_{in,out}`, `rope.inv_freq`.

Shapes confirm the arithmetic: `qkv_proj [21504, 5376]`, `out_proj [5376, 7168]`,
`fc1 [28672, 5376]`, `fc2 [5376, 14336]`, `adaln_proj.linear [96768, 2688]`
(260.1M params/block, the 13B/40% figure), `final_layer.adaln_proj.linear
[10752, 2688]`, `video_out [96, 5376]`, `audio_out [32, 5376]`.

Dtype census: **522 BF16 + 13 F32**, and the 13 fp32 tensors are exactly the set
the plan named — `{video,audio}_patch_proj.{weight,bias}`,
`time_embedder.proj_{in,out}.{weight,bias}`,
`final_layer.{video,audio}_out.{weight,bias}`, `rope.inv_freq`.

## AdaLN precompute (M3) measurements

- 49 evaluations, 2-3 distinct timesteps per step, **146 table rows**.
- `block_params [50, 438, 6, 5376]` bf16, `final_shift`/`final_scale` `[146, 5376]`.
- **1.416 GB total -> 0.354 GB/device at TP=4**, against 26.0 GB of `adaln_proj`
  weights (6.50 GB/device). **18x** fewer resident bytes; the 13B parameters never
  reach the device, taking the DiT from 16.6 to ~10.0 GB/device.
- Build reads the 26 GB once, streaming one block at a time: 6.8 s warm page cache.
- Rounding-order sensitivity quantified: activating in bf16 instead of fp32 shifts
  modulation by **7.8e-3**.

## Video VAE architecture (read from `FL2VA/video_vae/source/config.json`)

The real arch, which the outer `config.json` hides behind `source_path`:

**Encoder — CNN, causal.** `ch=128`, `ch_mult=[1,2,2,4,4,8]` (so 128 -> 1024),
`num_res_blocks=2`, `space_down=[2,2,2,2,1,1]` (16x), `time_down=[1,2,2,1,1,1]`
(4x), `use_3d_conv=true`, `causal_encoder=true`, `padding_mode="reflect"`,
`use_t_isolated_gn=true` (per-time-slice GroupNorm), `z_channels=24`.
`pixel_norm_type="imagenet"` — independent confirmation of amendment 8.

**Decoder — a 36-layer ViT, non-causal.** `use_vit_decoder=true`,
`causal_decoder=false`, `num_layers=36`, `heads=32`, `dim_head=64` (inner 2048),
`norm_type="rms_norm"` with `norm_affine=true`, `qk_norm_type="rms_norm"` with
**`qk_norm_affine=false`** (no weight at all), `ffn_use_gated=true` +
`ffn_activation_fn="silu"` (SwiGLU), 3D RoPE with `rope_dim_ratio=0.75` and
**`rope_theta=100.0`**, `space_up=[1,2,2,2,2,1]`, `time_up=null`.

This *lowers* the §9 "ViT-decoder primitives missing" risk. The decoder is a
transformer, so it reuses `layers/linear.py`, `RMSNorm` and the attention
machinery rather than needing new conv primitives; what `vae_ltx.py` /
`vae_wan2_1.py` lack is not needed. The encoder is the part that wants the
existing conv3d/halo infrastructure. Two genuine deltas to watch:
`qk_norm_affine=false` means the qk norms carry no parameters, and `rope_theta`
is 100.0 rather than the usual 10000.

## M8a design finding: the keyframe encoder is a 2D CNN

FL2VA conditioning only ever encodes **single frames** (T=1), and `BaseConv3d`
front-pads causally with **zeros**. So a 3-tap temporal conv sees `[0, 0, x]` and
collapses to `weight[:, :, -1] * x` — every temporal tap but the last is
multiplied by zero. Verified against the reference `BaseConv3d` for all four shapes
the encoder uses:

| conv | rel err vs 2D collapse |
|---|---|
| k3 pad1 reflect stride1 (`conv_in`, resnet `conv1`/`conv2`) | 1.51e-07 |
| k3 pad(1,0,0) stride(1,2,2) (`downsample`, space only) | 1.55e-07 |
| k3 pad(1,0,0) stride(2,2,2) (`downsample`, space+time) | 1.47e-07 |
| k1 pad0 (`nin_shortcut`, `quant_conv`) | **0.0, bit-exact** |

Chaining 12 of them — the encoder's resnet depth — leaves rel err at 1.13e-07, so
it is fp32 accumulation order and does not compound.

**Consequence: no conv3d, no temporal halo exchange, and no causal machinery for
the keyframe path.** M8a is a 2D CNN built on `layers/conv2d.py`, with the kernel
sliced to `weight[:, :, -1]` as a `_prepare_torch_state` fixup. `time_down` becomes
irrelevant (stride 2 over a 3-deep zero-padded axis still selects the one real
frame). Likewise `TemporalIsolatedGroupNorm` at T=1 is plain
`GroupNorm(num_groups=32, eps=1e-6, affine=True)`.

The T>1 encoder path is only needed for Ref2VA video references, which are out of
FL2VA scope; it can come later and will need the halo machinery.

### Implementation: conv3d mocking conv2d, per the WAN/LTX pattern

Do **not** use `layers/conv2d.py`. Reuse `WanConv2d`
(`models/vae/vae_wan2_1.py:733`, "a conv2d implemented with conv3d"), which is
already HW-parallel over `VaeHWParallelConfig`, does the H/W halo through
`neighbor_pad_persistent_buffer`, carries `logical_h`/`logical_w` masking, and
holds weights in the `prepare_conv3d_weights` layout. Its `_prepare_torch_state`
does `state["weight"].unsqueeze(2)` on a 4D conv2d weight, so H3 slots in by
slicing `weight[:, :, -1]` first — the same fixup the 2D collapse already needs.
Staying on the conv3d path also means the T>1 encoder is an extension later rather
than a rewrite. (`Conv2dViaConv3d` in `layers/audio_ops.py:407` is the same idea
but single-device, so it is precedent rather than the vehicle.)

**Open gap — reflect padding.** H3 sets `padding_mode="reflect"`;
`neighbor_pad_async` accepts only `zeros` and `replicate` (per its nanobind doc,
`neighbor_pad_async_nanobind.cpp:33`). This is narrower than it looks: at interior
shard boundaries the halo is the neighbour's real data, so the mode is irrelevant
and `replicate` is already exact there. The two differ only at the **global image
edges**, and only in the outermost 1 pixel: after a replicate pad the row layout is
`[x0, x0, x1, ...]` where reflect wants `[x1, x0, x1, ...]`.

Plan: pad with `replicate`, then blend the two global edge rows/cols to their
reflect values using a per-device edge mask. A per-device mask is sharded *data*,
so it stays SPMD-uniform in program structure — unlike the §5.2 modulation problem,
which needed differing op counts. Extending the C++ op with a reflect mode is the
alternative and touches a primitive WAN and LTX both depend on; prefer the blend.
Gate it explicitly: a 1-pixel border error is exactly the kind of thing that passes
PCC and looks like a subtle vignette.

Encoder structure confirmed against the checkpoint (560 tensors, **all fp32**):
`conv_in(3->128)`, 6 levels x 2 resnets with channels `[128,256,256,512,512,1024]`,
**3** `nin_shortcut` (levels 1/3/5, where in != out) and **4** `downsample` (levels
0-3) — exactly matching the derivation from `ch_mult`/`space_down`/`time_down` —
then `norm_out(1024)` + silu, `conv_out(1024->48)` (so `double_z=true`), and a
1x1x1 `quant_conv(48->48)`. Only `GroupNorm` needs care on TP: 32 groups / 4
devices = 8, and 128/256/512/1024 all divide by 4.

## §9 verdicts

| Risk | Verdict |
|---|---|
| 4096-row SP alignment waste | **CONFIRMED at bringup canvas**: 13.3% @ `k_chunk=512`, 5.45% @ 256. Canonical is only 0.54%, so this is a bringup-only concern. Re-measure device-side at M6 before changing the default. |
| Vision tower is required scope | **CONFIRMED** — a keyframe feeds both the VLM (as `<Picture i>:` + a vision block whose rows are video-tagged) and the video VAE. Plan and M7 updated; not optional. |

## Amendments to plan assumptions

1. **`last` keyframe anchor overshoots the final frame by 5.0 rotary units.**
   `origin + span(n) - 5/3` subtracts the shortest per-frame span (the `1` of
   `(1,4,4,4,4)`), not the final frame's actual span (a `4` when
   `(latent_t-1) % 5 != 0`). Reads as an off-by-one; it is not. Pinned by
   `test_keyframe_anchor_times`.
2. **diffusers builds the packed sequence with no padding at all**, stating
   padding "cannot influence a live row" — which is why its transformer needs no
   attention mask. Independently validates the plan's `logical_n = used` argument.
3. **Padding-waste estimates corrected** (see Measurements): canonical 0.54% not
   ~2%; bringup 13.3% not 19%, and `k_chunk=256` gives 5.45% not 0.02%.
4. **Text encoder is 50 of 64 layers**, `lm_head` unused, final
   `language_model.norm` **not** applied (~25.2B params / ~50 GB, not 62-66 GB).
5. **QKV is per-head interleaved** — confirmed, plan assumption held. Raw rows are
   `[head0_q(128), head0_k(128), head0_v(128), head1_q, ...]` = 56 x 384 = 21504.
   Reorder to `[q_all; k_all; v_all]` before use; keep fused for
   `ColParallelLinear(chunks=3)`. Source: `reorder_interleaved_qkv` in the
   diffusers `scripts/convert_minimax_h3_to_diffusers.py`, which says the
   reference applies exactly this at load time. No transposes anywhere in the
   conversion.
6. **`fc1` halves must be swapped — this was NOT in the plan and would have
   silently corrupted every FFN.** The checkpoint stores `[gate; value]` and the
   reference computes `fc2(silu(gate) * value)`, but tt_dit's swiglu is
   `t, gate = ttnn.chunk(t, 2, -1); t * ttnn.silu(gate)`
   (`models/tt_dit/layers/linear.py:441-443`), i.e. it wants `[value; gate]`.
   Swap halves in `_prepare_torch_state`, *then* let `permute_for_swiglu`
   (`linear.py:157-164`) do the cross-device interleave — that helper does not
   swap halves, it only redistributes an already-correct order. Plan §5.4 updated.

7. **RNG draw order resolved in favour of diffusers.** The two references genuinely
   differ: diffusers draws once per condition at that condition's own latent shape
   off the request generator, as the request's *first* draws (before video, then
   audio); sglang re-seeds `manual_seed(seed)` per condition and draws at
   `target_latent_t + cond_frames` before slicing. diffusers adopted as the
   HF/MiniMax-authored path. `noise_aug * clean + (1 - noise_aug) * noise` is
   identical in both, so only the stream differed.
8. **Keyframe pixels use ImageNet statistics, not `[-1, 1]`** —
   `mean (0.485, 0.456, 0.406)`, `std (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)`, applied to
   `pixels/255`. Not what the plan assumed. Verified: normalized values fall
   outside `[-1, 1]`.
9. **The sampled latent is rounded through float16 before normalization**, keeping
   ~11 bits. Measured effect vs fp32-exact: **maxdiff 7.5e-4** — well above noise,
   so the released model's conditioning cannot be reproduced without it. Guarded
   by `test_float16_round_trip_is_load_bearing`.
10. **The scheduler is rectified-flow Euler with `eta = 0`, not ancestral**, despite
    sglang naming its file `scheduling_minimax_h3_euler_ancestral.py`. Three
    inverted conventions, all verified: `t = 1 - sigma` with `t = 1` meaning
    *clean*; `x0 = x_t + sigma * v` (**plus**, not the usual flow-match minus); and
    `num_inference_steps` counts sigma grid points including the terminal 0, so
    **50 steps = 49 model evaluations**. Plan §5 wording corrected.
11. **`x0` recovers sigma from the timestep while the Euler ratio reads the sigma
    grid**, deliberately kept apart because `1 - (1 - sigma)` is not exact in fp32
    below sigma 0.5. Do not unify them.
12. **A second copy of the noise-aug formula drifted by 2.4e-7** because it computed
    `1 - t` in Python double instead of fp32. Removed; callers must use
    `MiniMaxH3Scheduler.scale_noise`, which is what the reference calls.
    `test_noise_augmentation_has_no_second_implementation` prevents its return.

## Hangs / resets

None yet. No device work has run.

`tt-smi -glx_reset` has standing permission for this goal. `tt-smi -r` remains
forbidden — it dropped all chips off PCIe on CPLD < 1.16.

## Failed attempts

- Three assertions of mine were wrong, not the port; in every case parity against
  the reference had already passed, which localized the fault to the test:
  `last`-anchor equality with the final frame (amendment 1), and twice an exact
  comparison against a Python float literal that is not fp32-representable
  (`0.7`, then `[1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0]`). Lesson: compare fp32 tensors to fp32
  tensors, never to Python literals.
- `pytest.raises` is rejected by the `prefer-expect-error` pre-commit hook; the
  repo requires the `expect_error` fixture from `conftest.py:881`.
- `pre-commit` needs `python_env/bin` on `PATH` or the commit aborts with
  "`pre-commit` not found". black/autoflake reformat on first run and abort the
  commit; re-add and re-commit. autoflake will strip an import the module no
  longer uses even if a *test* reads it through the module — import it from its
  real home instead.
- `Module` is an ABC with `forward` abstract, so a parameter-owning container
  cannot be instantiated for a load-only gate without declaring one.
- tt_dit's plain `RMSNorm` defaults to **`bias=True`**; every H3 norm is
  weight-only, so all of them need `bias=False`. `DistributedRMSNorm` asserts
  `not bias` and is unaffected.
- The broker appends `tt-metal` to `workspace`, so pass `workspace=/home/kevinmi`,
  not the repo root.
- Piping a device job to `tail -N` makes its log empty until exit — the known
  buffering trap, hit again. Stream to a file, or read the broker's job output.

## Device runs

| Job | What | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 222 | M4 first attempt | 3 failed: `Module` ABC needs `forward`. 35 s, clean close |
| 224 | M4 second attempt | 3 failed: `RMSNorm` bias keys missing. 90 s, clean close |
| 225 | M4 | **4 passed, 90.7 s**, clean close, JIT cache 100% hits |

Pre-run state for 225: device idle, `device_degraded` empty, no compute processes
holding the mesh (broker MCP servers only), host `g03blx02`, TT-KMD 2.9.0.
No hangs, no resets needed.

## Next step

**M8a — video VAE encoder on device.** Design is settled (above); this is now
implementation, not research. Write
`models/tt_dit/models/vae/vae_minimax_h3.py` with:

1. An H3 conv wrapping `WanConv2d`, whose `_prepare_torch_state` slices
   `weight[:, :, -1]` before delegating.
2. The reflect-edge blend over `replicate` neighbour padding.
3. `ResnetBlock` = GroupNorm(32, eps=1e-6, affine) + silu + conv, twice, plus a
   `nin_shortcut` k1 when in != out (levels 1/3/5).
4. `Downsample` = asymmetric spatial pre-pad `(0,1,0,1)` then stride-2 conv
   (levels 0-3).
5. `conv_in(3->128)`, 6 levels x 2 resnets over `[128,256,256,512,512,1024]`,
   `norm_out` + silu, `conv_out(1024->48)`, `quant_conv(48->48)`.
6. `VaeHWParallelConfig(height_parallel=(4,0), width_parallel=(8,1))`, fp32
   throughout — the whole VAE checkpoint is fp32.

Gates, in order: (a) a single H3 conv vs the reference `BaseConv3d` at T=1,
including the reflect edges — catches the padding gap directly; (b) one
`ResnetBlock`; (c) the full encoder's moments vs the reference `_encode_clip`,
`pcc >= 0.999`; (d) end-to-end against the already-gated
`conditioning.encode_keyframes`, with the seed-42 posterior sample drawn on host
and passed in.

Then **M8b** the 36-layer ViT decoder, **M8c** the audio VAE (BigVGAN decode
first, DAC encode second), before returning to M5.
