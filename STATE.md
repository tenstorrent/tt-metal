# MiniMax-H3 FL2VA on BH Galaxy 4x8 — execution state

Plan (source of truth for scope, order, contracts, gates):
`~/.claude/plans/elegant-wibbling-brooks.md`. Re-read both before every iteration.

Branch: `kevinmi/minimax-h3`, based on `c63d43b89ec`.
All PRs target `kevinmi/minimax-h3`.

## Branch base — read before any git operation

The branch was cut in place from `kevinmi/optimizer/rjsdpa-split-forward-2026-07-07`
rather than from `main`, because the working tree carries **5 uncommitted tracked
modifications that belong to that rjsdpa work, not to H3**:

```
models/tt_dit/layers/normalization.py
models/tt_dit/models/transformers/ltx/attention_ltx.py
ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/experimental/ccl/CMakeLists.txt
ttnn/cpp/ttnn/operations/experimental/ccl/ccl_experimental_nanobind.cpp
ttnn/sources.cmake
```

Plus untracked, also not H3: `benchmarks/`, `update_spi_data_table_glx`,
`models/tt_dit/tests/models/ltx/test_perf_ltx_layer_tpsp.py`.

**Never `git add -A`, never reset, never rebase over these.** Stage H3 paths
explicitly. Rebasing onto `main` is a decision for the user once that WIP is
resolved.

## Current milestone

**M2 complete.** Packing, conditioning, and the scheduler are ported and gated
bit-exact on host. Next: **M3 — AdaLN precompute**.

## Measurements recorded

From M2, on host (no device):

- Canonical 1344x768 / 192f / first+last keyframe: `used=61109`, padded 61440
  (0.54% waste @ `k_chunk=512`), M=3 unique timesteps, 6 global AdaLN runs,
  per-SP-shard runs `[6,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]` mean 1.75.
- Bringup 960x544 / 124f / first+last: `used=21301`, padded 24576 (**13.3%**
  waste @ `k_chunk=512`), 22528 (5.45%) @ `k_chunk=256`.
- `t2va` canonical: M=2, 3 global runs, mean 1.38 runs/shard.
- Shape algebra confirmed: 192f -> 57 latent frames, 320 audio latents;
  124f -> 37 latent frames, 207 audio latents.

## Checkpoint verification (M1, header-only reads, no device)

`FL2VA/transformer`: **535 tensors, 66.3 GB**. Every key name the plan assumed is
present and nothing else is: `blocks.{0..49}.{norm1,norm2,attn.{qkv_proj,out_proj,
q_norm,k_norm},mlp.{fc1,fc2},adaln_proj.linear}`, `token_refiner.blocks.{0,1}.*`
(no adaln, as expected) + `token_refiner.final_norm`, `final_layer.{norm,
adaln_proj.linear,video_out,audio_out}`, `{video,audio}_patch_proj`,
`condition_proj`, `time_embedder.proj_{in,out}`, `rope.inv_freq`.

Shapes confirm the arithmetic: `qkv_proj [21504, 5376]`, `out_proj [5376, 7168]`,
`fc1 [28672, 5376]`, `fc2 [5376, 14336]`, `adaln_proj.linear [96768, 2688]`
(260.1M params/block, the 13B/40% figure), `final_layer.adaln_proj.linear
[10752, 2688]`, `video_out [96, 5376]`, `audio_out [32, 5376]`.

Dtype census: **522 BF16 + 13 F32**, and the 13 fp32 tensors are exactly the set
the plan named — `{video,audio}_patch_proj.{weight,bias}`,
`time_embedder.proj_{in,out}.{weight,bias}`,
`final_layer.{video,audio}_out.{weight,bias}`, `rope.inv_freq`.

## §9 verdicts

| Risk | Verdict |
|---|---|
| 4096-row SP alignment waste | **CONFIRMED at bringup canvas**: 13.3% @ `k_chunk=512`, 5.45% @ 256. Canonical is only 0.54%, so this is a bringup-only concern. Re-measure device-side at M6 before changing the default. |
| Vision tower is required scope | **CONFIRMED** — a keyframe feeds both the VLM (as `<Picture i>:` + a vision block whose rows are video-tagged) and the video VAE. Plan and M7 updated; not optional. |

## Amendments to plan assumptions

1. **`last` keyframe anchor overshoots the final frame by 5.0 rotary units.**
   `origin + span(n) - 5/3` subtracts the shortest per-frame span (the `1` of
   `(1,4,4,4,4)`), not the final frame's actual span (a `4` when
   `(latent_t-1) % 5 != 0`). Reads as an off-by-one; it is not. Pinned by
   `test_keyframe_anchor_times`.
2. **diffusers builds the packed sequence with no padding at all**, stating
   padding "cannot influence a live row" — which is why its transformer needs no
   attention mask. Independently validates the plan's `logical_n = used` argument.
3. **Padding-waste estimates corrected** (see Measurements): canonical 0.54% not
   ~2%; bringup 13.3% not 19%, and `k_chunk=256` gives 5.45% not 0.02%.
4. **Text encoder is 50 of 64 layers**, `lm_head` unused, final
   `language_model.norm` **not** applied (~25.2B params / ~50 GB, not 62-66 GB).
5. **QKV is per-head interleaved** — confirmed, plan assumption held. Raw rows are
   `[head0_q(128), head0_k(128), head0_v(128), head1_q, ...]` = 56 x 384 = 21504.
   Reorder to `[q_all; k_all; v_all]` before use; keep fused for
   `ColParallelLinear(chunks=3)`. Source: `reorder_interleaved_qkv` in the
   diffusers `scripts/convert_minimax_h3_to_diffusers.py`, which says the
   reference applies exactly this at load time. No transposes anywhere in the
   conversion.
6. **`fc1` halves must be swapped — this was NOT in the plan and would have
   silently corrupted every FFN.** The checkpoint stores `[gate; value]` and the
   reference computes `fc2(silu(gate) * value)`, but tt_dit's swiglu is
   `t, gate = ttnn.chunk(t, 2, -1); t * ttnn.silu(gate)`
   (`models/tt_dit/layers/linear.py:441-443`), i.e. it wants `[value; gate]`.
   Swap halves in `_prepare_torch_state`, *then* let `permute_for_swiglu`
   (`linear.py:157-164`) do the cross-device interleave — that helper does not
   swap halves, it only redistributes an already-correct order. Plan §5.4 updated.

7. **RNG draw order resolved in favour of diffusers.** The two references genuinely
   differ: diffusers draws once per condition at that condition's own latent shape
   off the request generator, as the request's *first* draws (before video, then
   audio); sglang re-seeds `manual_seed(seed)` per condition and draws at
   `target_latent_t + cond_frames` before slicing. diffusers adopted as the
   HF/MiniMax-authored path. `noise_aug * clean + (1 - noise_aug) * noise` is
   identical in both, so only the stream differed.
8. **Keyframe pixels use ImageNet statistics, not `[-1, 1]`** —
   `mean (0.485, 0.456, 0.406)`, `std (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)`, applied to
   `pixels/255`. Not what the plan assumed. Verified: normalized values fall
   outside `[-1, 1]`.
9. **The sampled latent is rounded through float16 before normalization**, keeping
   ~11 bits. Measured effect vs fp32-exact: **maxdiff 7.5e-4** — well above noise,
   so the released model's conditioning cannot be reproduced without it. Guarded
   by `test_float16_round_trip_is_load_bearing`.
10. **The scheduler is rectified-flow Euler with `eta = 0`, not ancestral**, despite
    sglang naming its file `scheduling_minimax_h3_euler_ancestral.py`. Three
    inverted conventions, all verified: `t = 1 - sigma` with `t = 1` meaning
    *clean*; `x0 = x_t + sigma * v` (**plus**, not the usual flow-match minus); and
    `num_inference_steps` counts sigma grid points including the terminal 0, so
    **50 steps = 49 model evaluations**. Plan §5 wording corrected.
11. **`x0` recovers sigma from the timestep while the Euler ratio reads the sigma
    grid**, deliberately kept apart because `1 - (1 - sigma)` is not exact in fp32
    below sigma 0.5. Do not unify them.
12. **A second copy of the noise-aug formula drifted by 2.4e-7** because it computed
    `1 - t` in Python double instead of fp32. Removed; callers must use
    `MiniMaxH3Scheduler.scale_noise`, which is what the reference calls.
    `test_noise_augmentation_has_no_second_implementation` prevents its return.

## Hangs / resets

None yet. No device work has run.

`tt-smi -glx_reset` has standing permission for this goal. `tt-smi -r` remains
forbidden — it dropped all chips off PCIe on CPLD < 1.16.

## Failed attempts

- Three assertions of mine were wrong, not the port; in every case parity against
  the reference had already passed, which localized the fault to the test:
  `last`-anchor equality with the final frame (amendment 1), and twice an exact
  comparison against a Python float literal that is not fp32-representable
  (`0.7`, then `[1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0]`). Lesson: compare fp32 tensors to fp32
  tensors, never to Python literals.
- `pytest.raises` is rejected by the `prefer-expect-error` pre-commit hook; the
  repo requires the `expect_error` fixture from `conftest.py:881`.
- `pre-commit` needs `python_env/bin` on `PATH` or the commit aborts with
  "`pre-commit` not found".

## Next step

**M3 — AdaLN precompute.** Stream `blocks.*.adaln_proj.linear.{weight,bias}`
(50 x `[96768, 2688]`, ~13B params, 40% of the checkpoint) from safetensors once,
evaluate over the known `(step, timestep, modality)` set for a given schedule
config, and persist the ~1.4 GB table. The 13B weights then never reach the
device, taking the DiT from 16.6 to ~10.0 GB/device.

Gate: parity vs the reference `index_select` path, reproducing diffusers'
rounding order exactly — `temb` is shared across blocks and each AdaLN module
applies its **own** SiLU and casts to its own dtype afterwards
(`transformer_minimax_h3.py:124`), so the SiLU must not be hoisted. Host only.
