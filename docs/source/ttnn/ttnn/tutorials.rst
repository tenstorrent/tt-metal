This is a collection of tutorials written in Python to help you ramp up using TT-NN for various tasks such as tensor operations, model conversion, and profiling.

These tutorials assume you already have a machine set up with either a wormhole or blackhole device available and that you have successfully
followed the instructions for `TT-NN / TT-Metalium Installation <https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md>`_.

With the recommended virtual environment activated, you can run these tutorials directly:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 --version
   Python 3.10.12
   $ python3 example.py
   ...
