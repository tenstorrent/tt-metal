Profiling TT-NN Operations
==========================

The following set of commands will generate perf reports for ``resnet`` as an example.

..  code-block:: sh

    cd $TT_METAL_HOME
    build_metal.sh --enable-profiler
    ./tt_metal/tools/profiler/profile_this.py -n resnet -c "pytest models/demos/resnet/tests/test_perf_resnet.py::test_perf_bare_metal[20-0.0185-25]"

After the commands finish, the location of the generated csv will be printed on console similar to the image below:

.. image:: ../_static/ops_perf_location_example.png
    :alt: CSV path

The ``-n`` option is used to give a shorter version of the test name to be appended to the CSV file name and be used as the folder name.

The ``profile_this.py`` script and its CLI options are explained under `profile_this description`_.

The headers for the CSV are explained under `Perf Report Headers`_.

Instructions on using the performance report with `TT-NN Visualizer <https://github.com/tenstorrent/ttnn-visualizer>`_ are under `Using the Performance Report with TT-NN Visualizer`_.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:

- If this is the first time you are running ``profile_this.py``, it requires `developer dependencies <https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md#step-4-installing-developer-dependencies>`_ to be installed.
- If you have done a reset on your GS device with ``tt_smi`` or ``tensix_reset.sh``, profiling results are not valid due to tensix cores' skewed timer starts. You need to perform a full reboot with ``sudo reboot`` on your host machine to align the timer starts. WH does not have this issue and profiling can be performed after ``tt_smi`` resets.

- In order to populate program cache, tests should run their inference layer at least twice and should run it in the same process. If pytest is being used, that would be running in
  the same pytest run. Only the host times for the second run of the layer should be analyzed as the first run was populating the cache and will have much higher times for host side.

- The first 1000 ops for each device is automatically collected by pytest fixtures at the end of your test.
  If your test has more than 1000 ops, ``ttl.device.ReadDeviceProfiler(device)`` should be called at every n number of layers that total to less than 1000 ops in order to avoid dropping profiling data of new ops.
  For example for resnet with around 120 ops for a single inference layer, if the test calls the layer more than 8 times, ``ttl.device.ReadDeviceProfiler(device)`` should be called at least every eighth layer run.
  If profiling data is dropped, you will receive warning messages in the execution log mentioning which RISC of what core of what device dropped profiling data. Note that dispatch
  cores fill up their profiling buffers faster and if only those cores are giving warnings your OP analysis is not affected.

Perf Report Headers
-------------------

The OPs profiler report demonstrates the execution flow of the OPs in the pipeline. Each row in the CSV represents an OP executed.

For each OP, multiple data points are provided in the columns of the CSV.

The headers of the columns with their descriptions is below:

- **OP CODE**: Operation name, for C++ level OPs this code is the name of the class for the OP

- **OP TYPE**: Operation type, where the op ran and which part of code it is coming from

profile_this description
------------------------

CLI options of the  ``profile_this.py`` script are:

- ``-c``, ``--command``: This is the required CLI option for providing the test command that has to be profiled

- ``-o``, ``--output-folder``: This option is for providing the output folder for storing the performance report folder created. The default output folder is ``${TT_METAL_HOME}/generated/profiler/reports``

- ``-n``, ``--name-append``: Name to be appended to the the performance report folder and its files

- ``--collect-noc-traces``: Specifying this option will also create timeline files using `tt-npe <https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-npe>`_ in a subdirectory named ``npe_viz`` under the the perf report folder. These are used in the NPE tab on TT-NN Visualizer to visualize NoC traffic and congestion.
  **Note**: This option requires that npe is properly installed (See `here <https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-npe/blob/main/docs/src/getting_started.md#quick-start>`_ for instructions).

This scripts performs the following items:

1. Executes the provided under test command to generate both host and device side profiling logs
2. Post-processes all the collected logs and aggregate them into the perf csv with a timestamped name (e.g. ``ops_perf_results_2025_06_25_14_04_34.csv``)

Using the Performance Report with TT-NN Visualizer
--------------------------------------------------

The perf report should be created under a folder with a timestamped name (e.g. ``2025_06_25_14_04_34``) and look like the following (the ``npe_viz`` subdirectory only exists if ``--collect-noc-traces`` is specified):

.. image:: ../_static/tracy_perf_report.png
    :alt: Tracy performance report

This folder can be uploaded under the Reports tab in `TT-NN Visualizer <https://github.com/tenstorrent/ttnn-visualizer>`_:

.. image:: ../_static/ttnn_visualizer_perf_report_upload.png
    :alt: TT-NN Visualizer performance report upload

The uploaded data can then be viewed in the Performance tab:

.. image:: ../_static/ttnn_visualizer_performance.png
    :alt: TT-NN Visualizer Performance analysis

and NPE tab (if ``--collect-noc-traces`` was used):

.. image:: ../_static/ttnn_visualizer_npe.png
    :alt: TT-NN Visualizer NPE
