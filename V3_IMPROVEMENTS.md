# Version 3 - Battery Grid Layout! 🔋

## ✨ New in v3 - Your Feedback Implemented!

### 1. **Battery-Style Grid Layout** 🔋

Your boards are now arranged like batteries in a pack!

**Before (v2):** Linear row
```
Board 0      Board 1      Board 2      Board 3
  🔵🔵        🔵🔵          🔵🔵          🔵🔵
```

**After (v3):** 2×4 Grid (Battery Pack Style)
```
Board 0      Board 1      Board 2      Board 3
  🔵🔵        🔵🔵          🔵🔵          🔵🔵

Board 4      Board 5      Board 6      Board 7
  🔵🔵        🔵🔵          🔵🔵          🔵🔵
```

**Your T3K (4 boards):** 2×2 Grid
```
Board 0      Board 1
  🔵🔵        🔵🔵

Board 2      Board 3
  🔵🔵        🔵🔵
```

Like 4 AA batteries side-by-side!

### 2. **Smart Line Routing** 🎯

**Intra-board connections (chips on same board):**
- ✅ **Straight BLUE lines** (no need to curve!)
- ✅ Solid, direct connections
- ✅ Width: 2px

**Inter-board connections (chips on different boards):**
- ✅ **Curved GRAY lines** (avoid crossing other boards)
- ✅ Lift above obstacles
- ✅ Width: 3px

```
Same Board:                Different Boards:
🔵 ━━━━ 🔵                       ╱‾‾╲
(Straight blue)        🔵 ────╱    ╲──── 🔵
                              (Curved gray)
```

### 3. **Click for Coordinates** 📍

## 📊 Line Types in Detail

### Intra-Board Lines (Blue)

**Example: Chips 0 and 1 on same N300 board**
```
Board 0
┌─────────┐
│  🔵━━🔵  │  ← Straight blue line
│  0    1  │
└─────────┘
```

**Why straight?**
- Chips are close together
- On same physical board
- No obstacles between them
- Clear and simple

### Inter-Board Lines (Gray)

**Example: Chip 0 (Board 0) to Chip 3 (Board 1)**
```
Board 0          Board 1
┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│  🔵      │      │      🔵  │
│  0 ─────┼──╱‾‾╲┼───── 3  │
└─────────┘ ╱    ╲ ────────┘
           (Curves above)
```

**Why curved?**
- Boards are separated
- May have other boards in between
- Curves lift above obstacles
- Professional appearance

## 🎯 Benefits

### Compact Layout
- ✅ Better use of 3D space
- ✅ Boards organized in rows/columns
- ✅ Easy to see relationships

### Visual Clarity
- ✅ Blue lines = local (same board)
- ✅ Gray lines = long-distance (different boards)
- ✅ Instant understanding of topology

### Professional
- ✅ Looks like real hardware layout
- ✅ Battery pack metaphor is familiar
- ✅ Great for presentations

## 🎮 Usage

### Generate for Your System
```bash
./visualize_topology_3d_enhanced_v3.py \\
    --cluster t3k_phys_topology.yaml \\
    --mesh t3k_generated_mesh.yaml
```

### Open and Explore
```bash
# Copy to local
scp user@remote:/workspace/tt-metal-apv/topology_3d_battery.html .

# Open in browser
open topology_3d_battery.html

# Try these:
# 1. Look at blue lines (intra-board, straight)
# 2. Look at gray lines (inter-board, curved)
# 3. Click any element for coordinates
# 4. Rotate to see 2×2 grid from different angles
```

## 💡 Design Principles

### Why Battery Grid?

**Familiar Metaphor:**
- Everyone knows battery packs
- Cells arranged in rows/columns
- Compact and organized

**Optimal for T3K:**
- 4 boards → 2×2 grid
- Perfect symmetry
- Easy to visualize

**Scalable:**
- 2 boards → 1×2
- 4 boards → 2×2
- 6 boards → 2×3
- 8 boards → 2×4
- Larger → square grid

### Why Different Line Types?

**Blue = Local:**
- Chips on same PCB
- Physical proximity
- Direct connection
- No obstacles

**Gray = Remote:**
- Chips on different PCBs
- May have obstacles
- Need to route around
- Longer distance
