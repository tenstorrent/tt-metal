# Generated C++ / EmitC Testing

Tests in this directory were generated by `tt-mlir` compiler's codegen feature.

The purpose of this directory is to provide a place where `tt-mlir` developers can easily "inject" generated C++ code and share with developers of this repo, often with the goal of sharing a repro of a bug.

It contains a header file `emitc.hpp` which should not be freely edited. The header file contents match the infra used within the `tt-mlir` compiler to run the generated code - editing it might break things.
