# CMake configuration tests
# These tests validate CMake functionality like distro detection and MPI configuration

# Note: These are Python-based tests that simulate CMake behavior
# They can be run with: pytest tests/cmake/

# No CMake targets needed here - these are pure Python unit tests
# that can be run independently with pytest
