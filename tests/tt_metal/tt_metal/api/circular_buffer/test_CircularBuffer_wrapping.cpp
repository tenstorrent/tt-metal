/**
 *
 * This test checks that the cb_reserve_back and cb_wait_front will wait correctly when the internal counters of CB
 * overflows at the PACKER core.
 *
 * To dive into a bit more detail, CB is implemented with 2 counters, received and acked, where received counter
 * indicates the amount of pages pushed into CB, and acked counter indicates the amount of pages popped from CB. The
 * calculation of received and acked counter is done in 16 bits. Naturally, the received counter will be bigger than the
 * acked counter, which would be reverted when received counter overflows. Prior to #26536, the calculation for the
 * amount of free pages left in the system does not handle the overflow correctly, resulting in cb_reserve_back
 * returning prematurely.
 *
 * Because we cannot directly test if functions are hanging correctly, we test for data corruption instead. If
 * cb_reserve_back or cb_wait_front does not handle overflow correctly when calculating the amount of free pages left/
 * amount of pages pending, they will return prematurely, resulting in writing data to non-freed pages, which would
 * cause data corruption. If no data corruption is detected, it means that the overflow is handled correctly.
 *
 * The test is setup with:
 * A writer kernel at PACK core, and a reader kernel at NOC1 core;
 * A CB with 64 pages (1024 bytes with 16 bytes per page)
 *
 * We define a "step" as 32 pages, so the CB holds 2 "steps", all the calls to cb_reserve_back, cb_push_back,
 * cb_wait_front and cb_pop_front will be called with a multiple of "step" pages.
 *
 * Step by step of how the test works:
 * 1. Reader + Writer churns through the received and acked counter till the acked and received counter 2 steps till
 * overflow.
 * 2. Reader enters a spin loop, stop consuming from the CB.
 * 3. Writer fills the CB with 2 steps of data of value A, now the CB should be full of value A.
 * 4. Writer calls cb_reserve_back and attempts to write 1 steps of data B.
 *    If cb_reserve_back handles the overflow correctly, it will hang and wait for reader.
 *    If cb_reserve_back handles the overflow incorrectly, it will be incorrectly overwritten the first step of A with
 *    B.
 * 5. Reader exits spin, reads all pending data (3 steps worth of data)
 *    If cb_reserve_back handles the overflow correctly, it should hang writer till reader exits spin, resulting in BBA.
 *    If cb_reserve_back handles the overflow incorrectly, premature write will happen before reader exists spin,
 *    resulting in ABA (first step of pages is overwritten with A).
