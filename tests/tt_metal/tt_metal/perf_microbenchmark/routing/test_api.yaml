# Receiver's job is to check incoming packets and verify that they are correct.
# If we increase max_configs_per_core, each receiver/sender can support more traffic patterns, increasing test size.
# However, this reduces the amount of L1 memory that each traffic pattern is allocated during the test.
# Worst case, if the buffer size is too small, a sender may have sent a new packet before the receiver has validated the current packet, causing errors.
# There is currently no handshaking to protect against this.

Tests:
  - name: "TestName"
    fabric_setup:
      topology: Linear/Mesh/Ring/Torus # The logical topology we're testing.
      # LowLatency: Each packet is loaded with an infiniband-style packet header, where a segment is peeled off for each hop.
      # Dynamic: Every time a packet arrives at a router, the router checks its routing table to figure out where to send it.
      (optional) routing_type: LowLatency/Dynamic
      # Tensix extension for fabric routers, used to build connections between worker->fabric router, upstream fabric router->downstream fabric router.
      (optional) fabric_tensix_config: Default/Mux
      # Controls the number of ETH links on each chip that is used in the test.
      # Each sender is duplicated N times, 1 for each link. Allows a single traffic pattern to be sent multiple times simultaneously to the same destination

      (optional) torus_config: XY/X/Y # Only used for Torus topology, to specify torus links

    # When specifying a test, we have two options
    # 1. Specify a concrete list of senders
    # 2. Specify a high-level pattern
    # 1. Concrete list of senders
    (optional) senders:
        # Alternatives to Physical chip ID for device:
        # 1. Logical device format [mesh_id, chip_id]
        # 2. Mesh coordinate format [mesh_id, [row, col]]
      - device: 0 # Physical chip ID
        (optional) core: [1, 1] # [row, col] of the sender worker core.
        patterns:
          - (optional) ftype: unicast/mcast # Fabric traffic pattern
            (optional) ntype: unicast_write/atomic_inc/fused_atomic_inc/unicast_scatter_write # NoC traffic pattern once on chip
            (optional) size: 1024 # Size of each packet in bytes
            (optional) num_packets: 100 # Number of packets to send
            (optional) destination:
              - (optional) device: 1 # Or [mesh_id, chip_id] or [mesh_id, [row, col]]
                (optional) core: [1, 1] # [row, col] of the receiver worker core.
                (optional) hops: # multicast only

            (optional) atomic_inc_val: 1 # Only used for atomic_inc ntype, how much to increment by.
            (optional) atomic_inc_wrap: 65535 # Only used for atomic_inc ntype, the maximum value of the remote counter after which it will wrap to 0.
            # How many hops to perform before starting the multicast. Used for grid-based multicasting.
            # For example, if the source is [0,0] and the destination is [0,1], and mcast_start_hops is 1, the multicast will start at [0,1].
            (optional) mcast_start_hops: 0
    # 2. High-level pattern
    (optional) patterns:
      - type: all_to_all/one_to_all/full_device_random_pairing/unidirectional_linear/full_ring/half_ring/all_devices_uniform_pattern
        (optional) iterations: 2 # How many times to run the pattern.
      - type: all_to_all
      - type: one_to_all
        (optional) iterations: 3
        # NOTE: all_to_one is a special pattern. If no iterations are specified, the test is expanded into n iterations, where n refers to the number of chips in the test.
        # In each iteration, the receiver will be located on a different chip.
        # However, if iterations are specified, the test is only expanded into 'iterations' number of tests, which may reduce test coverage.
      - type: all_to_one
        (optional) iterations: 5

    # How iterations works:
    # expand_high_level_patterns in tt_fabric_test_config.hpp:
    # 1. Before running any tests, the framework determines the max iterations across all high-level patterns.
    # 2. All patterns will be run simultaneously in each iteration.
    # expand_patterns_into_test in tt_fabric_test_config.hpp:
    # 1. All patterns are given a new random seed, for randomized iterations.
    # NOTE: Only the maximum number of iterations is used to determine the number of tests to run.
    # In the case above, 5 iterations of the tests will be created, even though the first pattern only requests 2.



    # Allows us to sweep multiple test configurations.
    # The Framework generates new tests based on these parameters and inserts them into the test list.

    (optional) benchmark_mode: true/false # If true, the framework will save run results into a csv file.

    #Allows us to ensure that all traffic patterns start at roughly the same time.

    (optional) bw_calc_func: "MyCustomBWFunc" # Not used
    # on_missing_param_policy targets the following parameters in all tests: [ftype, ntype, size, num_packets].
    # If on_missing_param_policy is set to "randomize", the framework randomizes the missing parameters.
    # If on_missing_param_policy is not provided, the framework provides sane defaults for missing parameters.
