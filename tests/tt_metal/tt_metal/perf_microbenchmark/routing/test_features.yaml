# This YAML file demonstrates the various features of the fabric performance test framework.
# It will be updated as new features are added.

# ======================================================================================
# Optional Top-Level Configuration: Allocation Policies
# This block allows you to globally configure how sender and receiver worker cores
# are allocated across all tests in this file.
# ======================================================================================
allocation_policies:
  # This sets the payload chunk size for all workers, sender and receiver.
  default_payload_chunk_size: 4096
  sender:
    # Policy can be 'RoundRobin' or 'ExhaustFirst'.
    # 'ExhaustFirst' will fill up one core with workers before moving to the next.
    # 'RoundRobin' will distribute workers one by one across available cores.
    policy: ExhaustFirst
    max_configs_per_core: 2
    # The initial number of cores to use for allocation before needing to add more.
    initial_pool_size: 1
    # When the initial pool is exhausted, how many new cores to add.
    pool_refill_size: 1
  receiver:
    policy: RoundRobin
    max_configs_per_core: 8

  # Test 2: Parametrized All-to-All Test on a Mesh.
  # This shows how to use high-level patterns and parametrization to generate

  #   - AllToAll_size_256_num_packets_100

  # Test 4: Full Device Random Pairing Pattern
