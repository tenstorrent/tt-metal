      This test appears to be broken. The graph is showing numbers that dont make sense.

      This test shows the ideal read and write bandwidth when transferring multiple 8KB packets.
      The read bandwidth is what is expected, however write bandwidth is expected to be 64
      B/cycle rather than 35 B/cycle. There may be some configuration problem with the dram
      controller/phy or this may be the physical limit of the dram.

      This is a 2 reader reshard. It seems to be getting expected perf based on number of transactions
      and transactions size. Reshard perf is dictated based on the number of transactions and the
      transaction size. A small number of transactions will result in small perf due to large
      round trip latency. It is suggested to use a large number of transactions, with large transaction
      size to get the best performance.

      Convolution has a large number of transactions and a small transaction size. The performance is
      similar to what it would be for a similarly configured one from one. Convolution may benefit from
      having multiple cores doing different parts of the convolution at the same time. This would
      result in a larger effective bandwidth.

      The performance of this test is similar to how other tests perform based on the number of
      transactions and the transaction size, but with extra degradation due to needing to read
      parameters from L1.

      With a single core the graphs shows performance increases as the threshold increases.
      This is because frequent flushes don't hide the round trip latency.

      With multiple cores the graph shows that a small threshold always provides bad performance.
      This is because frequent flushes don't hide the round trip latency. At larger thresholds,
      the performance starts to fluctuate due to head-of-line blocking and unfairness in the NOC.
      Performance fluctuates because the flush disturbs the steady state and will randomly create
      traffic that sometimes has head of line blocking, and sometimes does not.
