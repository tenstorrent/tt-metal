# Multi Interleaved Data Movement Tests

This test suite implements tests that measure the functionality and performance (i.e. bandwidth) of data movement transactions between DRAM interleaved buffers and multiple Tensix cores.

## Mesh Device API Support
This test suite uses the TT-Metal Mesh Device API, which provides a unified interface for single and multi-device operations. The tests use `GenericMeshDeviceFixture` and run on single-device unit meshes.

**Note**: The Mesh Device API only supports fast dispatch mode internally and does not support slow dispatch mode. This provides optimal performance for data movement operations.

## Test Flow
Runs a reader kernel and/or a writer kernel on a grid of tensix cores.

The reader kernel issues NOC instructions to read data from an interleaved DRAM buffer, initialized with data, into the L1 address of the Tensix cores calling the read_page API. A read barrier is placed after these transactions in order to ensure data validity. If the reader kernel isn't run, this data is initially written directly into L1 memory.

The writer kernel issues NOC instructions to write data from the L1 address of the Tensix cores into an interleaved DRAM buffer. A write barrier is placed after these transactions in order to ensure data validity.

Transactions exceeding 16 pages will consecutively overwrite the same 16 pages so as not to take up excess L1 memory. Test attributes such as transaction sizes and number of transactions as well as latency measures like kernel and pre-determined scope cycles are recorded by the profiler. Resulting data is read from the output interleaved buffer if the writer kernel is run (or directly from L1 memory otherwise), cross-checked with original data, and validated through a pcc check.

Test expectations are that pcc checks pass and sufficient test attribute data is captured by the profiler for higher level bandwidth/regression checks.

## Running the Tests
The tests use the Mesh Device API with fast dispatch mode:
```
./build/test/tt_metal/unit_tests_data_movement --gtest_filter="*MultiInterleaved*"
```

## Test Parameters
| Parameter                 | Data Type             | Description |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| test_id                   | uint32_t              | Test id for signifying different test cases. Can be used for grouping different tests. |
| num_of_transactions       | uint32_t              | Number of transactions in test. |
| num_pages                 | uint32_t              | Number of page read/writes per transaction. |
| page_size_bytes           | uint32_t              | Size of a page in bytes (max 1 packet - 16kB for BH, 8kB for WH). |
| l1_data_format            | DataFormat            | Type of data in transaction. |
| cores                     | CoreRangeSet          | Logical coordinates of Tensix cores running kernels. |
| read_kernel               | bool                  | True if test runs reader kernel. |
| write_kernel              | bool                  | True if test runs writer kernel. |

## Test Cases
Each test case uses bfloat16 as L1 data format.
Each test case has multiple runs, and each run has a unique runtime host id, assigned by a global counter.

1. Multi Interleaved Sizes: Tests reading and writing with interleaved DRAM buffer over varying number of transactions and transaction sizes over the full grid of Tensix cores.
2. Multi Interleaved Page Directed Ideal: Tests the most optimal transactions for reading/writing pages by maximizing the number of pages and page size to amortize initialization overhead and saturate the bandwidth over the full grid of Tensix cores.
3. Read tests: Run only the reader kernel.
4. Write tests: Run only the writer kernel.
5. Grid configuration tests: Run kernel(s) on a 2x2 or on a 6x6 grid of Tensix cores.
