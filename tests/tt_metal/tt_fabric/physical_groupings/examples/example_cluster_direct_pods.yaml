# Example: Cluster Containing Pods Directly
# This example shows a cluster skipping superpods and containing pods directly

groupings:
  - base_units:
      - asic_location_1
      - asic_location_2
      - asic_location_3
      - asic_location_4
      - asic_location_5
      - asic_location_6

  - trays:
      asic_locations: [asic_location_1, asic_location_2, asic_location_3, asic_location_4, asic_location_5, asic_location_6, asic_location_7, asic_location_8]

  - hosts:
      trays: 4

  - meshes:
      hosts: 1  # Each mesh = 1 host (smaller mesh example)

  - pods:
      meshes: 2

  - superpods:
      pods: 2  # Superpods still need to be defined (even if not used by clusters)

  - clusters:
      pods: 6  # Cluster contains 6 pods directly (skipping superpods)
