# Example: Complex Multi-Level Mixing
# This example shows groupings containing multiple types of lower-level groupings

groupings:
  - base_units:
      - asic_location_1
      - asic_location_2
      - asic_location_3
      - asic_location_4
      - asic_location_5
      - asic_location_6
      - asic_location_7
      - asic_location_8

  - trays:
      asic_locations: [asic_location_1, asic_location_2, asic_location_3, asic_location_4, asic_location_5, asic_location_6, asic_location_7, asic_location_8]

  - hosts:
      trays: 4

  - meshes:
      hosts: 1  # Each mesh = 1 host (meshes can have 1 item)

  - pods:
      meshes: 2  # Each pod = 2 meshes

  - superpods:
      pods: 2  # Each superpod = 2 pods
      meshes: 2  # Also contains 2 meshes directly (in addition to pods)

  - clusters:
      superpods: 2
      pods: 2  # Also contains 2 pods directly
      meshes: 3  # Also contains 3 meshes directly
