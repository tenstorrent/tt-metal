# Example: Mesh with Subdivided ASIC Locations Using Custom Groupings
# This example shows defining a custom grouping called "halftray" twice
# with different ASIC locations (1-4 and 5-8), both representing a half tray concept

groupings:
  - base_units:
      - asic_location_1
      - asic_location_2
      - asic_location_3
      - asic_location_4
      - asic_location_5
      - asic_location_6
      - asic_location_7
      - asic_location_8

  - trays:
      asic_locations: [asic_location_1, asic_location_2, asic_location_3, asic_location_4, asic_location_5, asic_location_6, asic_location_7, asic_location_8]

  - hosts:
      trays: 4

  # Custom grouping: Half tray - defined twice with different ASIC locations
  # Both represent a "half tray" concept
  - halftray:
      asic_locations: [asic_location_1, asic_location_2, asic_location_3, asic_location_4]  # Lower half (locations 1-4)

  - halftray:
      asic_locations: [asic_location_5, asic_location_6, asic_location_7, asic_location_8]  # Upper half (locations 5-8)

  - meshes:
      halftray: 1  # Each mesh uses 1 half tray (can be either lower or upper)

  - pods:
      meshes: 2

  - superpods:
      pods: 2

  - clusters:
      superpods: 2
