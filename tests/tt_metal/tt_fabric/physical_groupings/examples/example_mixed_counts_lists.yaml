# Example: Mixed Counts - Combining Different Grouping Types
# This example shows mixing different types of lower-level groupings within a single grouping
# You can combine pods, meshes, superpods, etc. in any combination

groupings:
  - base_units:
      - asic_location_1
      - asic_location_2
      - asic_location_3
      - asic_location_4
      - asic_location_5
      - asic_location_6
      - asic_location_7
      - asic_location_8

  - trays:
      asic_locations: [asic_location_1, asic_location_2, asic_location_3, asic_location_4, asic_location_5, asic_location_6, asic_location_7, asic_location_8]

  - hosts:
      trays: 4

  - meshes:
      hosts: 1  # Each mesh contains 1 host (meshes can have 1 item)

  - pods:
      meshes: 2  # Each pod contains 2 meshes
      # Can also mix: meshes: 2, hosts: 8, etc. (if referencing lower-level units)

  - superpods:
      pods: 2  # Contains 2 pods
      meshes: 4  # Also contains 4 meshes directly (mixed with pods)
      # Example: 2 pods + 4 meshes = 8 total meshes (2 from pods + 4 direct)

  - clusters:
      superpods: 2  # Contains 2 superpods
      pods: 2  # Also contains 2 pods directly
      meshes: 3  # Also contains 3 meshes directly
      # Example: 2 superpods (each with 2 pods + 4 meshes) + 2 pods + 3 meshes
