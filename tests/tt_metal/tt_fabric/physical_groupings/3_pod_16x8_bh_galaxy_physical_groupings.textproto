# Physical Groupings File for 3-Pod 16x8 Blackhole Galaxy Cluster
# This file defines groupings in terms of base units without requiring ASIC IDs
# The actual ASIC IDs are derived at runtime from the Physical System Descriptor (PSD)
#
# Base units (ASIC locations 1-8) are predefined as enum constants:
# ASIC_LOCATION_1, ASIC_LOCATION_2, ..., ASIC_LOCATION_8
# No need to define them - they're always available
