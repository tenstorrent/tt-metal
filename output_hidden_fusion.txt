We need to create a new fused op for deepseek_v3_b1.
Lets call the opp output_hidden under deepseek_v3_b1/fused_ops .
The op needs to run matmul followed by a gather.
matmul shape: [1, 8192] x [8192, 6144]
matmul output shape: [1, 6144]
matmul runs on 96 cores on 8x12 core grid

Look at pres_dpa_kernel.cpp for reference. It runs a matmul followed by a gather with other ops running before and after.
Reference matmul and gather ops are under deepseek_v3_b1/micro_ops/matmul and deepseek_v3_b1/micro_ops/gather.
Reference tests are under deepseek_v3_b1/tests/unit_tests/test_matmul.py and deepseek_v3_b1/tests/unit_tests/test_gather.py, deepseek_v3_b1/tests/unit_tests/test_pre_sdpa.py
