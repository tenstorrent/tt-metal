# TTNN Device to MeshDevice Migration Guide

# Introduction

There is a major change being merged to TT-Metal & TTNN in relation to working with multiple devices. Currently, TTNN manages multi-device tensors and operations by creating a tensor on each of user exposed device and deploying the same OP on each device with a lot of non-trivial multi-threading and synchronization involved.
This management of multiple devices is being lowered to Metal layer. More specifically:
1.  A TTNN user will always see a MeshDevice.
    - This object has the same APIs as the Device object, currently exposed to users.
	- When interfacing with mutiple devices, the MeshDevice will span the extent of the physical cluster.
	- For cases where users want to control a single physical device a Unit-Mesh (1x1 MeshDevice) Handle will be provided.
	- The user experience should remain unchanged in either case, since the MeshDevice APIs are backwards compatible with the Device APIs.
2.  Tensors will be allocated in lock-step on multiple physical devices while being backed by the newly introduced MeshBuffer. The cluster of physical devices is virtualized by a single MeshDevice and the MeshBuffer resides in the distributed memory space exposed by the MeshDevice. This implies that:
	- MultiDeviceStorage is being removed in favour of always using DeviceStorage
	- Tensor allocations go through the MeshDevice allocator (instead of individual device allocators), so the buffer on each of the devices gets the same address.
	- The behavior of `get_device_tensors` changes to return a single-device view into the multi-device Tensor (backed by a MeshBuffer).
	- To call `aggregate_as_tensor` for Tensors on device, all of them must be backed by the same MeshBuffer.
	- If a user wants to aggregate a collection of individual Tensor shards before sending them to device.`aggregate_as_tensor` can be called on the host tensors: `aggregate_as_tensor(host_tensors).to(mesh_device)`.
3. Each operation is dispatched to multiple devices by Metal, instead of by TTNN.
	- TTNN lowers each user defined operation to a MeshWorkload instead of a Program.
	- TT-Metal handles multi-threaded dispatch of the MeshWorkload to the MeshDevice, making TTNN runtime much simpler.
	- The MeshWorkload structure allows users to natively express Multi-Device operations while providing a clean separation of the tasks between TTNN (OP Lowering) and TT-Metal (Workload Dispatch)

This change results in multiple benefits for both TTNN developers and TTNN users:
1. TTNN host dispatch implementation is drastically simplified ðŸŽ‰
2.  There are no more waits to acquire Tensor metadata, it is returned immediately, since TTNN is synchronous ðŸŽ‰
3. Significant performance improvements ðŸŽ‰
4. Thereâ€™s no need to create multiple threads in neither TTNN or user code, all of the multi-threading is handled internally by TT-Metal ðŸŽ‰

## Limitations

This major change comes with a few limitations. Specifically:

1.  It is impossible to interleave calls to MeshDevice and a single Device managed by it. The user has to make a choice which one to use and stick to it.
2.  All Tensor buffers are allocated in lock-step on all devices within the Mesh. This means it is impossible to have a multi-device Tensor which has different addresses on different devices, unless one is willing to spawn a collection of MeshDevices.
3.  You can not aggregate arbitrary Tensors from different mesh devices into a multi-device Tensor due to (1) and (2).
4.  All workloads are executed in lock-step fashion across all devices within MeshDevice, one MeshWorkload at a time. The MeshWorkload itself can be homogenous (one program targeting the entire MeshDevice) or heterogenous (different programs running on different physical devices).


## Migration Steps (Applicable to C++ Users Only)

This section provides a set of steps for C++ users to seamlessly port their codebase to TT-Mesh. For Python users, changes introduced by TT-Mesh should be effectively abstracted away, since the TTNN Python APIs have already been ported to support the new backend.

### 1. Update Device Management
For cases where you want to explicitly control each physical device, instead of seeing a Virtualized MeshDevice, please follow the steps below.

Replace all usages of `CreateDevice` as follows:
```cpp
// Old
tt::tt_metal::IDevice* device = tt::tt_metal::CreateDevice(device_id);
// New
#include <tt-metallium/distributed.hpp>

std::shared_ptr<tt::tt_metal::distributed::MeshDevice> device = tt::tt_metal::distributed::MeshDevice::create_unit_mesh(device_id);
```
Analogously you should replace calls to `ttnn::open_device` with `ttnn::open_mesh_device` and calls to `CreateDevices` with `create_unit_meshes`.

Please note the type of the returned device has changed to a shared_ptr, so thereâ€™s no need to explicitly call `CloseDevice`/`CloseDevices`/`ttnn::close_device` anymore if youâ€™re using RAII.
```cpp
// Remove this line
tt::tt_metal::CloseDevice(device);
```

If you need to close the device before destroying the object, you should simply call `device->close();`.

### 2. Remove Device/IDevice
You should replace all mentions of `tt::tt_metal::IDevice` or `tt::tt_metal::Device` in your codebase with `tt::tt_metal::distributed::MeshDevice

### 3. Remove command_queue() calls
All calls to `device->command_queue()` are fundamentally incompatible with MeshDevice, and an exception will be thrown on any such call. You should replace all usages of `command_queue()` with `mesh_command_queue()` in your codebase. Some specific use-cases may require special attention as listed below.

### 4. Event synchronization

With migration to MeshDevice, event synchronization calls should be updated as well:
```cpp
// Old CQ -> CQ and CQ -> Host  (Events are recorded on the device and propagated to host)
auto  event = std::make_shared<Event>();
ttnn::record_event(device->command_queue(*io_cq), event);
ttnn::wait_for_event(device->command_queue(*op_cq), event); // op_cq waits for an event from io_cq
ttnn::event_synchronize(event); // host waits for an event from io_cq

// New MeshCQ -> Host (User Controls whether an Event should be propagated to host or not)
auto event = ttnn::record_event_to_host(device->mesh_command_queue(*io_cq));
ttnn::event_synchronize(event);

// New MeshCQ -> MeshCQ (Event is not propagated to host -> faster)
auto event = ttnn::record_event(device->mesh_command_queue(*io_cq));
ttnn::wait_for_event(device->mesh_command_queue(*op_cq), event);
```
### 5. Manual calls to Metal APIs
Ideally, TTNN users should use Tensors and TT-NN OPs instead of direct access to Metal buffers/programs. However, if you have direct calls to those APIs in your codebase, they would need to be updated as follows:

```cpp
// Old tensor_impl::allocate_buffer_on_device
auto input_buffer = tt::tt_metal::tensor_impl::allocate_buffer_on_device(device,  tensor_spec);
auto  storage = tt::tt_metal::DeviceStorage{input_buffer};

// New allocate_tensor_on_mesh (preferred replacement)
auto  input_tensor = allocate_tensor_on_mesh(tensor_spec, device.get());

// New tensor_impl::allocate_mesh_buffer_on_device
auto input_buffer = tt::tt_metal::tensor_impl::allocate_mesh_buffer_on_device(device, tensor_spec);
auto storage = tt::tt_metal::DeviceStorage{input_buffer,  DistributedTensorConfig{},  {{tt::tt_metal::distributed::MeshCoordinate{0,  0},  tensor_spec}}};

// Old EnqueueProgram
tt::tt_metal::EnqueueProgram(device->command_queue(), program, true);

// New EnqueueMeshWorkload
tt::tt_metal::distributed::MeshWorkload workload;
workload.add_program(device->get_view().coord_range(), std::move(program));
tt_metal::distributed::EnqueueMeshWorkload(device->mesh_command_queue(0),  workload,  true);

// Old CreateBuffer
tt_metal::InterleavedBufferConfig  buff_config{.device = device, .size = dram_buffer_size,  .page_size = page_size, .buffer_type = buffType};
auto buffer = CreateBuffer(buff_config);

// New MeshBuffer::create
tt_metal::distributed::DeviceLocalBufferConfig  buff_config{.page_size = page_size,  .buffer_type = buffType};
tt_metal::distributed::MeshBufferConfig  mesh_config = tt_metal::distributed::ReplicatedBufferConfig{.size = dram_buffer_size};
auto buffer = tt_metal::distributed::MeshBuffer::create(mesh_config, buff_config, device.get());

// Old WriteToBuffer
tt_metal::detail::WriteToBuffer(src_buffer, src_vec);

// New WriteShard
tt_metal::distributed::WriteShard(device->mesh_command_queue(0), src_mesh_buffer, src_vec, *device->get_view().coord_range().begin());

// Old ReadFromBuffer
tt_metal::detail::ReadFromBuffer(dst_mesh_buffer, result_vec);

// New ReadShard
tt_metal::distributed::ReadShard(device->mesh_command_queue(0), result_vec, dst_mesh_buffer,
*device->get_view().coord_range().begin());

```
### Possible issues

#### OwnedStorage vs MultiDeviceHostStorage

In some cases, Tensors which used to have OwnedStorage may have MultiDeviceHostStorage with a single owned buffer after the migration. It may break some usages and the user code needs to be updated to handle another storage type.
