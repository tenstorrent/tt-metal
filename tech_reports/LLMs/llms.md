## 1. Overview
## 2. Modules
### 2.1 Embedding
### 2.2 RoPE
  - Iterative update system
  - When to use our fused op
### 2.3 Norm
  - Replicated layernorm vs distributed layernorm
    - Layernorm/rmsnorm weights in row major / wrapped around tile size trick
### 2.4 Attention
  - Flash Attention and Flash Decode
    - general description
    - limitations
    - which dims are parallelized
### 2.5 MLP
### 2.6 Decoder
### 2.7 LM Head
## 3. Features
### 3.1 Generative Decoding
### 3.2 Prefill and Decode
  - submodules, tests
  - how to combine prefill and decode, 
  - slicing prefill to fit in L1
### 3.3 Multi-Device
  - device mesh
  - column parallel followed by row parallel
  - sharding, CCL ops, reducing CCL overheads, etc.
### 3.4 Continuous Batching
  - quick intro and how it is implemented in demos.
### 3.5 vLLM Integration
  - Our vLLM repo and what's needed to integrate with it.
## 4. Best Practices and Optimizations
### 4.1 Tracing
  - link to existing doc, why it helps decode more
### 4.2 Async Mode
### 4.3 Multiple CQs
  - how to feed back output to input and read output asyncronously
### 4.4 Op Configs
  - Writing correct program configs and shard specs 
  - Deciding how many cores to run an op on
    - Why did we use 16 cores for MLP
  - Which matmul to use when @Colman Glagovich 
    - 1d, 2d, dram-sharded, ...
  - Implicitly padding weights in program config for matmuls
### 4.5 Accuracy
  - How we measure it (PCC, perplexity, top-1/top-5, end-user tests, benchmarking)
  - How much PCC is enough? Rules of thumb.
  - Accuracy tests
  - Debugging PCC issues
### 4.6 Performance Analysis
  - Performance tooling, tracy
### 4.7 Misc. Performance Optimizations
  - Which dim to shard matmuls on
  - DRAM-sharding
  - Avoiding sharded to interleaved calls
### 4.8 Module Tests
### 4.9 Performance Testing
### 4.10 Common Pitfalls
#### 4.10.1 Error Messages
  - Running out of L1
  - Shard spec and program config mismatches
  - For some TTNN ops (e.g. ttnn.all_gather) it's not supported to pass -1 in the dim argument. 
    - You'll see an error related to op invocation where the arguments don't match
#### 4.10.2 Shard Spec Mismatches
#### 4.10.3 Ethernet Dispatch Cores
  - link to any other description, and mention it is needed for N300 and T3K
#### 4.10.4 Hangs
##### 4.10.4.1 Host Communication
##### 4.10.4.2 Tracing
  - Host communications cause tracing to hang
  - Running without async mode enabled causes tracing to hang
  - Careful with print in tracing
##### 4.10.4.3 Large Matmuls
  - Large matmuls hanging? Link to appropriate di/dt ticket with workaround and say an issue is being investigated with a workaround of setting the output subblock to 1,1 but don’t explicitly use the words di/dt in the document
