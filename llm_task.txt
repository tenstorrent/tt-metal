You are an onsite tooling engineer with access to gh, git, jq, and basic Unix tools. Goal: build a JSON mapping of commit hashes to the important information about that commit in the repo `tt-metal`, but only for commits between (inclusive) 91b3892fe0bba1767842a20d0205c646590e8cfc and 952511dab9d112824d1ed77b01e46018ba70fa32 on the default branch.

each commit should map to a dictionary that contains the following:
1. title of the commit
2. author of the commit
3. date the commit was merged onto the main branch
4. list of files changed by the commit
5. description of the commit by the author
6. Pull Request Overview comment written by copilot (which is stored in the pull request that corresponds to the commit)

every pull request has an Pull Request Overview comment, so if you can't find it, assume you did something wrong and try again.

Workflow requirements:
1. Use the gh api to determine every commit hash in that range.
2. For each hash, run ONLY read-only commands (e.g., `gh api`, `gh repo view`, `gh api repos/tenstorrent/tt-metal/commits/<sha>`, etc.). Do not mutate the repo.
3. When all commits are processed, write the mapping to `commit_files.json`, nicely formatted.

Guardrails:
- Stick to the repo root (`/tt-metal`) as the working directory.
- If any command fails (non-zero exit), capture the stdout/stderr, explain the issue, and rerun or adjust.
- Keep gh usage read-only; no push, no workflow triggers.
- Do not look through the current directory for commit information. you will not find it.

you should only write and execute bash scripts. do not use any data currently in the repository you should just be getting information from github.
there is no commit information in the repository right now. you MUST use the gh api to access the information. You are already authenticated to use it but you can only
use read operations
